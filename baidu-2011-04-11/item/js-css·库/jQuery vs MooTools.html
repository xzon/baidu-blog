 <p>Most people getting started with JavaScript these days are faced with the challenging task of picking a library to use, or at least which one to learn first. If you're working for a company chances are they have already chosen a framework for you, in which case the point is somewhat moot. If this is the case and they've chosen <a href="http://www.mootools.net/" target="_blank">MooTools</a> and you're used to <a href="http://www.jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, then this article might still be of some use to you.</p> 
 <p><a href="http://twitter.com/joshink/statuses/1671986611" target="_blank">Every</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/jezusisstoer/statuses/1642244246" target="_blank">day</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/digitalcampaign/statuses/1622094648" target="_blank">on</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/jesswma/statuses/1605733380" target="_blank">twitter</a> I see numerous posts that boil down to &quot;MooTools or jQuery?&quot; This article aims to help you make that choice.</p> 
 <h3>Disclaimer</h3> 
 <p>I am a MooTools developer. I work on the MooTools framework. I blog about MooTools. I wrote <a href="http://www.mootorial.com/" target="_blank">the main online tutorial</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430209836?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=clientside-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=1430209836" target="_blank">the book about MooTools</a>. Obviously, I have a perspective that is somewhat biased. I'll also point out that I don't use jQuery that often. If you're a jQuery developer and see anything that I have misrepresented here, please contact me and help me rectify the issue. My objective here is to be helpful and accurate to people - not to sell one framework over another.</p> 
 <h3>Purpose</h3> 
 <p>Helping you make a choice between these two frameworks involves me telling you how they are different. I'll start out by saying that both of them are excellent choices. You can't make a wrong choice here. Both frameworks have their strengths and weaknesses, but, in general, they are both great choices. There are other frameworks out there that are worth digging into as well. <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/" target="_blank">Dojo</a>, <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/" target="_blank">Prototype</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/" target="_blank">YUI</a>, <a href="http://extjs.com/" target="_blank">Ext</a> and others are all great choices. Which one you choose really has more to do with your own style and what you need to accomplish. The purpose of this article is to focus on MooTools and jQuery, as increasingly these are the two frameworks that I see a lot of people considering. Finally, I'm not trying to convince anyone to switch from one framework to the other. There are interesting things about both frameworks from which you can learn. You can read a little more about this article and why I wrote it in <a href="http://www.clientcide.com/3rd-party-libraries/jquery-vs-mootools-mootools-vs-jquery/" target="_blank">my blog post on Clientcide where I announced it</a>.</p>

 <h2>The Mottos Say It All</h2> 
 <p>If you go to the jQuery site, here's what it says at the top of the page:</p> 
 <blockquote>
  jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript.
 </blockquote> 
 <p>...and if you go to MooTools, this is what you'll find:</p> 
 <blockquote>
  MooTools is a compact, modular, Object-Oriented JavaScript framework designed for the intermediate to advanced JavaScript developer. It allows you to write powerful, flexible, and cross-browser code with its elegant, well documented, and coherent API.
 </blockquote> 
 <p>I think this really sums it up. If you ask me (and you're reading this, so I'll assume you just have), the question isn't about which framework is better or worse. It's which one of these things above do you want to do? These two frameworks just aren't trying to do the same things. They overlap in the functionality they provide, but they are not trying to do the same things.</p> 
 <p>jQuery's description of itself talks about HTML, events, animations, Ajax, and web development. MooTools talks about object oriented-ness and writing powerful and flexible code. jQuery aspires to &quot;change the way you write JavaScript&quot; while MooTools is designed for the intermediate to advanced JavaScript developer.</p> 
 <p>Part of this consideration is the notion of a framework vs a toolkit. MooTools is a framework that attempts to implement JavaScript as it should be (according to MooTools' authors). The aim is to implement an API that feels like JavaScript and enhances everything; not just the DOM. jQuery is a toolkit that gives you an easy to use collection of methods in a self-contained system designed to make the DOM itself more pleasant. It just so happens that the DOM is where most people focus their effort when writing JavaScript, so in many cases, jQuery is all you need.</p> 
 <p>Most of the code you write when you write MooTools still feels like JavaScript. If you aren't interested in JavaScript as a language, then learning MooTools is going to feel like a chore. If you are interested in JavaScript and what makes it interesting, powerful, and expressive, then, personally, I think MooTools is the better choice.</p> 
 <img alt="锚点" src="image/jQuery vs MooTools.h.spacer.gif-t=A8LE4JO" />
 <p class="origImg">http://ckeditor.com/apps/ckeditor/3.4.1/images/spacer.gif?t=A8LE4JO</p> 
 <h2>The Learning Curve and The Community</h2> 
 <p>First, jQuery is, by and large, easier to learn. It has an almost colloquial style that almost doesn't feel like programming. If all you want is to get something working quickly without learning JavaScript, jQuery is probably a better choice for you. It's not that MooTools can't help you accomplish the same things, but I'll admit that MooTools can be a little harder to get the hang of if you're new to JavaScript and also that there are just a lot of resources out there to help you learn jQuery - more than there are for MooTools at least.</p> 
 <p>If you compare the jQuery community (<a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Discussion" target="_blank">see the &quot;Discussion&quot; page on jQuery</a>) and the MooTools community (<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#mootools" target="_blank">irc</a>, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mootools-users" target="_blank">mailing list</a>, and <a href="http://mooforum.net/" target="_blank">unofficial forum</a>) you'll quickly discover two things: 1) the jQuery community is far larger (I attribute this mostly to the point I made above about how easy it is to learn, but also because...) and 2) they are more active in promoting the library. If you measure jQuery and MooTools on metrics like the number of people using it, the number of search queries run on Google, the number of books sold, etc, you'll see jQuery is ahead by a wide margin.</p> 
 <p>To tell you why you might consider MooTools I'll first need to talk a little bit about what both the frameworks do. Ultimately which framework you choose is going to come down to what you want to accomplish and how you like to program (and maybe even if you like to program, at least in JavaScript).</p> 
 <img alt="锚点" src="image/jQuery vs MooTools.h.spacer.gif-t=A8LE4JO" />
 <p class="origImg">http://ckeditor.com/apps/ckeditor/3.4.1/images/spacer.gif?t=A8LE4JO</p> 
 <h2>What JavaScript Is Good For</h2> 
 <p>Part of making this choice is asking what you want to do with JavaScript. Let's consider vanilla JavaScript. No framework; just plain old JS. JavaScript gives you native objects like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_ _1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/String" target="_blank">Strings</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_ _1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Number" target="_blank">Numbers</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_ _1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Function" target="_blank">Functions</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_ _1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Array" target="_blank">Arrays</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_ _1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Date" target="_blank">Dates</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_ _1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp" target="_blank">Regular Expressions</a>, and more. JavaScript also gives you an inheritance model - a somewhat esoteric model called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_ _1.5_Guide/Inheritance" target="_blank">prototypal inheritance</a> (which I'll talk about more later). These building blocks and the concept of inheritance are the bread and butter of any programming language and they have absolutely nothing to do with browsers or the web or CSS or HTML. You could write anything you wanted to in JavaScript. Tic-tac-toe, chess, photoediting, a web server, whatever. It just so happens that 99% of all the JavaScript out there is run in browsers and that's what we think of it as. The programming language for browsers.</p> 
 <p>Understanding that the browser, the DOM, is just where we happen to use JS most of the time but that it's actually a very robust and expressive programming language will help you understand the difference between MooTools and jQuery.</p> 
 <img alt="锚点" src="image/jQuery vs MooTools.h.spacer.gif-t=A8LE4JO" />
 <p class="origImg">http://ckeditor.com/apps/ckeditor/3.4.1/images/spacer.gif?t=A8LE4JO</p> 
 <h3>More Than Just The DOM</h3> 
 <p>If you think of the tasks that we want to accomplish in JavaScript strictly in terms of &quot;get stuff on the page and do stuff to it&quot; then jQuery is probably the best choice. It excels at offering a very expressive system for describing behavior on the page in a way that doesn't feel like programming sometimes. You can still use the rest of JavaScript to do what you want to do, but if you're focused on the DOM - changing CSS properties, animating things, fetching content via AJAX, etc - most of what you'll end up writing will be covered by jQuery, and what isn't will likely be plain-old JavaScript. jQuery does provide some methods that aren't about the DOM; for example, it provides a mechanism for iterating over arrays - <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities/jQuery.each" target="_blank">$.each(array, fn)</a> - or, for example, it offers a trim method for strings - <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities/jQuery.trim" target="_blank">$.trim(str)</a>. But there aren't a ton of these types of utility methods, which is fine because, for the most part, if you're just getting stuff out of the DOM, iterating over them, and altering them in some way (adding html, changing styles, adding event listeners for click and mouseover, etc) you don't need much else.</p> 
 <p>But if you think of JavaScript's scope in its full breadth, you can see that jQuery doesn't focus on things outside of the DOM. This is one of the reasons it is so easy to learn, but it also limits the ways it can help you write JavaScript. It's just not trying to be anything other than a solid programming system for the DOM. It doesn't address inheritance nor does it address the basic utilities of all the native types in the JavaScript language, but it doesn't need to. If you want to mess around with strings, dates, regular expressions, arrays and functions, you can. It's just not jQuery's job to help you do it. JavaScript as a language is there at your feet. jQuery makes the DOM your playground, but the rest of JavaScript is just not in its scope.</p> 
 <p>This is where MooTools is vastly different. Rather than focusing exclusively on the DOM (though, as I'll get into in a bit, it offers all the functionality that jQuery does but accomplishes this in a very different manner), MooTools takes into its scope the entire language. If jQuery makes the DOM your playground, MooTools aims to make JavaScript your playground, and this is one of the reasons why it's harder to learn.</p>

 <p class="origImg">http://ckeditor.com/apps/ckeditor/3.4.1/images/spacer.gif?t=A8LE4JO</p> 
 <h3>Inheritance with JavaScript</h3> 
 <p>The JavaScript programming language has some really awesome things about it. For starters, it's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" target="_blank">functional language</a>, which means that it treats functions as high-order objects that can be passed around as variables just like any other object - strings or numbers for example. It's designed with this concept in mind and many of the methods and patterns in it work best when you write code this way. It's the difference between:</p> 
 <pre>for (var i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) { /* do stuff */ }</pre> 
 <p>and</p> 
 <pre>myArray.forEach(function(item, index) { /* do stuff */ });</pre> 
 <p>JavaScript has an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_ _1.5_Guide/Inheritance" target="_blank">inheritance model</a> that is not quite unique but at least rather rare in programming languages. Instead of classes that are defined that can be subclassed it passes along traits through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming" target="_blank">prototypal inheritance</a>. This means that objects inherit directly from other objects. If you reference a property on an object that inherits from another object, the language inspects the child object for that property and, if it doesn't find it, looks for it on the parent. This is how a method on, say, an array works. When you type:</p> 
 <pre>[1,2,3].forEach(function(item) { alert(item) }); //this alerts 1 then 2 then 3</pre> 
 <p>the method &quot;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_ _1.5_Reference:Objects:Array:forEach" target="_blank">forEach</a>&quot; is not a property of the array you declare ([1,2,3]), it is a property of the prototype for all Arrays. When you reference this method the language looks for a method called forEach on your array, and, not finding it, then looks at the prototype for all arrays. This means that the forEach method is not in memory once for every array in memory; it is only in memory for the prototype of arrays. This is incredibly efficient and ultimately quite powerful. (Side note: MooTools aliases the forEach method as each)</p> 
 <img alt="锚点" src="image/jQuery vs MooTools.h.spacer.gif-t=A8LE4JO" />
 <p class="origImg">http://ckeditor.com/apps/ckeditor/3.4.1/images/spacer.gif?t=A8LE4JO</p> 
 <h3>Self Reference</h3> 
 <p>Javascript has a special word: &quot;this&quot;. It's hard for me to succinctly define what &quot;this&quot; is all about but, by default, &quot;this&quot; is the object to which the current method belongs. It allows objects to refer to themselves within their methods as they would otherwise have no means to do so. This becomes important when you create children objects and have numerous instances of that object; how else could the method of an object refer to itself? When the actual copy of the method exists on the parent, not the child, the &quot;this&quot; keyword allows these instances to refer to their own state. (<a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/js/this.html" target="_blank">here's a much more complete description of the &quot;this&quot; keyword</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_ _1.5_Reference/Operators/Special_Operators/This_Operator" target="_blank">another from Mozilla</a>.)</p> 
 <p>The &quot;this&quot; keyword allows objects that inherit from other objects to refer to themselves, but there are times when you may want to reference something else through &quot;this&quot;. This is called <a href="http://alternateidea.com/blog/articles/2007/7/18/ -scope-and-binding" target="_blank">binding</a>, wherein you specify a different &quot;this&quot; for a method. The &quot;each&quot; method on Array allows you to specify the bound object with a second argument. Here's an example of where you might want to pass in a different &quot;this&quot;:</p> 
 <pre>var ninja = {
    weapons: ['katana', 'throwing stars', 'exploding palm technique'],
    log: function(message) {
        console.log(message);
    },
    logInventory: function() {
        this.weapons.each(function(weapon) {
   //we want &quot;this&quot; to point to ninja...
            this.log('this ninja can kill with its ' + weapon);
        }, this); //so we pass &quot;this&quot; (which is ninja) to Array.each  
    }
};
ninja.logInventory(); 
//this ninja can kill with its katana
//this ninja can kill with its throwing stars
//this ninja can kill with its exploding palm technique</pre> 
 <p>In the example above, we bind ninja (which is &quot;this&quot; inside the logInventory method) to the method we pass to the array so that we can refer to the log property of ninja. If we didn't do this, &quot;this&quot; would be window.</p> 
 <p>These are just some examples of the power and expressiveness that JavaScript has to offer - inheritance, self reference and binding, and efficient prototype properties. The bad news is that vanilla JavaScript doesn't make these powerful things very useful or accessible, and this is where MooTools starts. It makes these types of patterns easy and rather pleasant to use. You end up writing more abstract code, and in the long run, this is a good thing - a powerful thing. Learning how these patterns are valuable and how to use them properly takes effort, but the up side is that the code you author is both highly reusable and much easier to maintain. I'll talk about these two things a bit more in a minute.</p> 
 <img alt="锚点" src="image/jQuery vs MooTools.h.spacer.gif-t=A8LE4JO" />
 <p class="origImg">http://ckeditor.com/apps/ckeditor/3.4.1/images/spacer.gif?t=A8LE4JO</p> 
 <h2>MooTools Makes JavaScript Itself More Fun</h2> 
 <p>Because MooTools focuses on making the JavaScript API itself more stable and coherent, it is focused less on giving you an interface that &quot;changes the way you write JavaScript&quot; and more on making JavaScript as a whole less frustrating; MooTools is an extension to the JavaScript language. MooTools tries to make JavaScript the way it is meant to be. A significant portion of the core library is spent on augmenting Function, String, Array, Number, Element and other prototypes. The other big thing it offers is a function called <a href="http://mootools.net/docs/core/Class/Class" target="_blank">Class</a>.</p> 
 <p>Now, Class looks to many people like it's trying to recreate a more classical inheritance model that one might find in Java or C++, but that's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_ _1.5_Guide/Class-Based_vs._Prototype-Based_" target="_blank">not the case</a>. What Class does is make the prototypal inheritance model of JavaScript easier for you and me to access and take advantage of. I'll note that these concepts are not unique to MooTools (other frameworks offer similar functionality), but both of these concepts are not present in jQuery. jQuery does not offer an inheritance system nor does it offer any enhancements to native objects (Function, String, etc). This is not a deficiency of jQuery as the authors of jQuery could easily offer these things. Rather, they have designed a toolkit with a different goal in mind. Where MooTools aims to make JavaScript more fun, jQuery aims to make the DOM more fun and its designers have chosen to limit their scope to that task.</p> 
 <img alt="锚点" src="image/jQuery vs MooTools.h.spacer.gif-t=A8LE4JO" />
 <p class="origImg">http://ckeditor.com/apps/ckeditor/3.4.1/images/spacer.gif?t=A8LE4JO</p> 
 <h2>jQuery Makes the DOM More Fun</h2> 
 <p>And this is why jQuery is more accessible. It doesn't ask that you learn JavaScript inside and out. It doesn't throw you into the deep end with prototypal inheritance, binding, &quot;this&quot;, and native prototypes. When you get started with jQuery in its <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:How_jQuery_Works" target="_blank">official tutorial</a>, this is the first jQuery code example you find:</p> 
 <pre>window.onload = function() {
    alert(&quot;welcome&quot;);
}</pre> 
 <p>and here's the third:</p> 
 <pre>$(document).ready(function() {
    $(&quot;a&quot;).click(function(event) {
        alert(&quot;Thanks for visiting!&quot;);
    });
});</pre> 
 <p>If you read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430209836?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=clientside-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=1430209836" target="_blank">the MooTools book</a> or the <a href="http://www.mootorial.com/wiki" target="_blank">MooTools tutorial</a> (both of which I authored) they start in a much different place. While you can skip ahead and quickly learn about effects and the DOM, if you want to learn MooTools, you have to start with things like Class, and, I'll admit: if you're new to programming, or you just want to get something working on your site without having to learn everything about JavaScript, chances are jQuery is going to look a lot more friendly to you.</p> 
 <p>On the other hand, if you want to learn JavaScript itself, MooTools is a great way to do it. It implements a lot of things that JavaScript is going to have (many of the methods on Natives are just the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/New_in_ _1.8" target="_blank">JavaScript 1.8</a> spec and beyond). If you're used to programming, especially both object oriented and functional programming, MooTools has a lot of design patterns that are very exciting and expressive.</p> 
 <img alt="锚点" src="image/jQuery vs MooTools.h.spacer.gif-t=A8LE4JO" />
 <p class="origImg">http://ckeditor.com/apps/ckeditor/3.4.1/images/spacer.gif?t=A8LE4JO</p> 
 <h2>Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better</h2> 
 <p>If you look at the things jQuery can do, there's often a counterpart in MooTools. If you look at the things MooTools can do, there is often no way to emulate it using jQuery code because of jQuery's focus on the DOM. MooTools has a broader functionality than jQuery, but there's nothing about jQuery that prevents you from doing those things. For example, jQuery does not come with any sort of inheritance system, but that's ok. You could, if you want, use the MooTools Class in conjunction with jQuery if you wanted to (or write your own). There's even <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jquery-inheritance/updates/list" target="_blank">an inheritance plug-in for jQuery</a> (I haven't used it, but I assume it offers pretty much the same kind of functionality).</p> 
 <p>If we look at the example from jQuery above:</p> 
 <pre>$(document).ready(function() {
    $(&quot;a&quot;).click(function(event) {
        alert(&quot;Thanks for visiting!&quot;);
    });
});</pre> 
 <p>and we wanted to translate this to MooTools, we'd have:</p> 
 <pre>window.addEvent('domready', function() {
    $$('a').addEvent('click', function(event) {
        alert('Thanks for visiting!');
    });
});</pre> 
 <p>These are very similar no?</p> 
 <p>Here's a more complex example from jQuery:</p> 
 <pre>$(document).ready(function() {
    $(&quot;#orderedlist li:last&quot;).hover(function() {
        $(this).addClass(&quot;green&quot;);
    },
    function() {
        $(this).removeClass(&quot;green&quot;);
    });
});</pre> 
 <p>and in MooTools:</p> 
 <pre>window.addEvent('domready',function() {
    $$('#orderedlist li:last-child').addEvents({
        mouseenter: function() {
            this.addClass('green');
        },
        mouseleave: function() {
            this.removeClass('green');
        }
    });
});</pre> 
 <p>Again, very similar. I'd argue that the MooTools version is more explicit, but also more verbose because of it. It's clear reading the MooTools code that we're adding two events - one for mouse enter and one on mouse leave, while the jQuery version is more concise; its <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Events/hover" target="_blank">hover</a> method accepts two methods - the first for mouse enter and the second for mouse leave. I personally like the fact that the MooTools code is more legible but that's a very subjective observation.</p> 
 <p>I will say that sometimes jQuery can become too esoteric for my taste. The methods don't always make sense to me just looking at them and I find it hard to parse. This is somewhat unfair though, as I am intimately familiar with MooTools, so reading MooTools is easy for me. But one of the things I appreciate about MooTools is how almost all the method and class names really name the thing. Methods are almost always verbs and leave little doubt as to what they do. Every programming language requires you to go to the docs to look up syntax when you write it - I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that I find the API of MooTools to be more coherent and consistent.</p>

 <h2>MooTools Lets You Have It Your Way</h2> 
 <p>But what if you like the jQuery syntax? One way to illustrate the power of MooTools is to show you how easy it is to change it to suit your tastes. If we wanted to implement the hover method from jQuery in MooTools, we could easily do so:</p> 
 <pre>Element.implement({
    hover : function(enter,leave){
       return this.addEvents({ mouseenter : enter, mouseleave : leave });
    }
});

//and then you could use it exactly like the jQuery version:
$$('#orderlist li:last').hover(function(){
   this.addClass('green');
},
function(){
   this.removeClass('green');
});</pre> 
 <p>Indeed, there are MooTools plug-ins that do just that; <a href="http://github.com/cheeaun/mooj/tree/master" target="_blank">give you the jQuery syntax for MooTools</a>. MooTools' focus on extensibility means you can implement anything you like. This is something jQuery can't do. MooTools can mimic jQuery if you want it to, but jQuery can't mimic MooTools. If you want to write classes or extend native prototypes or do some of the other things MooTools can, you'll have to write it yourself.</p>
