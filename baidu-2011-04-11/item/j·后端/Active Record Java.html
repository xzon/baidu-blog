<p><a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html">Active Record</a> is a design pattern frequently found in enterprise applications and as per the definition goes as <strong>&quot;An object that wraps a row in a database table or view, encapsulates the database access, and adds domain logic on that data&quot;.</strong></p> 
<p>Using ARJ you dont have to define any XML file mappings, most of the things are handled for you. Only thing you have to do is name your class file name same as table name. There are no rules for table name only thing is to name your class file as table name and you are done.</p> 
<p>Eg: Parent(Java class file) =&gt; parent(table name).</p> 
<p>You don't need to define variables like &quot;private String name&quot; , during startup metadata is read from the database and also the relationships between tables of type 1..*.With metadata the track of all the variables and their datatype is kept.</p> 
<pre><strong>Eg:<br />                     parent table:-&gt;<br />                     id | int(11) | PRI<br />                     name | varchar(15)<br />                     <br />                     The class Parent will have<br />                     public class Parent extends ActiveRecordJava{<br />                         public Parent(){}<br />                     }</strong></pre> 
<br /> 
<p>static find<br /> <strong>Parent parent = find(&quot;parent&quot;,1);</strong><br /> this will take string &quot;parent&quot; the table name and the next id i.e 1 and return instance of Parent class.</p> 
<p>to access fields you have to make a call like......<br /> <strong>parent.get(&quot;name&quot;);</strong><br /> <strong>parent.get(&quot;address&quot;);</strong></p> 
<p>There is 1..* relation between parent and child table.<br /> This you dont need to define anywhere in class file.<br /> Both Parent and Child class file are clean.<br /> <br /> <strong>Child child = find(&quot;child&quot;, 1);</strong><br /> <strong>Parent p=child.belongsTo(&quot;parent&quot;);</strong><br /> <br /> to get the other side i.e all children of parent.<br /> <strong>p.listOfAll(&quot;child&quot;)</strong> will return arraylist of all values.</p> 
<p>Only thing that you have to write is for *..* as it doesn't makes sense for detecting this kind of relation from metadata.You will have to initialize the relation in constructor.<br /> <strong>public Products() {</strong><br /> <strong>markMany(&quot;customers&quot;,&quot;through:customers_products&quot;);</strong><br /> <strong>}</strong></p> to get arraylist of customers
<br /> 
<strong>Products products = find(&quot;products&quot;,1);</strong>
<br /> 
<strong>products.hasMany(&quot;customers&quot;);</strong>
<br /> usage:-&gt;
<br /> 
<strong>ArrayList&lt;Customers&gt; cst = products.hasMany(&quot;customers&quot;);</strong>
<br /> 
<strong>Customers c1 = cst.get(0);</strong>
