<p>JSmooth is a Java Executable Wrapper that builds standard Windows<br /> executable binaries (.exe) that launch java applications. Such binaries<br /> contain all the information needed to launch your java application,<br /> i.e. the classpath, the java properties, the jvm version required, and<br /> so on. If Java is not installed, it helps the users by displaying them a<br /> notice before launching automatically a browser to a web site where they<br /> can download a JVM.</p> 
<p>1. Status of the project</p> 
<p>JSmooth is currently in advanced beta phase.</p> 
<p>2 Using the software</p> 
<p>Double-clik on the JSmoothGen.exe icon.</p> 
<p>3. Compiling the project</p> 
<p>-- PREREQUISITE --</p> 
<p>The section below only applies if you need to build JSmooth from its<br /> sources. If you just need to create an executable binary for your<br /> application, just run JSmoothGen as it comes from its standard<br /> distribution.<br /> <br /> 3.1 Get the source</p> 
<p>You can get the source code at sourceforge's:<br /> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsmooth">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsmooth</a></p> 
<p>3.2 MINGW for Windows (required)</p> 
<p>You need the MINGW GCC compiler to compile the Windows wrappers. Just<br /> install the last version (3.1.0 or above) from the following website:</p> 
<p><a href="http://www.mingw.org/">http://www.mingw.org/</a></p> 
<p>You need to download the MINGW-v.exe package (where v is the<br /> version). For instance MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe should be fine. You don't need<br /> any other package, so don't be afraid of all the stuff available on<br /> their web site.</p> 
<p>Once installed, you still need to setup your %PATH% environment<br /> variable to add the bin/ directory where MINGW is installed.<br /> <br /> 3.3 DOCUMENTATION STUFF (optional)</p> 
<p>If you want to build the whole distribution package (including the<br /> documentation, you need to install the docbook compilation chain).</p> 
<p>Install:</p> 
<p>- <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/">http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/</a> and put the xalan jars into<br /> the lib folder of ANT. This is required to make ANT able to<br /> process XSLT.</p> 
<p>- docbook-xsl, available at<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/</a><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; Just download the docbook-xsl package, you don't need anything<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you compile with a JDK 1.5 or above, you are very likely<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; to experience issues with the built-in xslt engine. A<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; work-around is to override the default engine with xalan<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; (for instance). Download Xalan and put its jars in the<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; jre/lib/endorsed/ directory (you may have to create it).</p> 
<p>- FOP, available at <a href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">http://xml.apache.org/fop/</a></p> 
<p>3.4 FLTK library</p> 
<p>FLTK, available at <a href="http://www.fltk.org/">http://www.fltk.org</a> The easiest way is probably to<br /> grab a recent source package of fltk, then to run under an MSYS/MINGW<br /> environment the three commands: &quot;./configure&quot;, &quot;make&quot;, and &quot;make<br /> install&quot;.</p> 
<p>3.5 Configure:</p> 
<p>- Open the build.xml ant script at the root of the project, and<br /> change the properties located at the top of the file. They are just<br /> under the comment:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!-- set here the properties specific to your computer --&gt;</p> 
<p>Read carefully the comments and set the properties accordingly.</p> 
<p>3.6 Building the project</p> 
<p>To build the project, run the following command: ant jar<br /> To build the wrappers: ant compileskels<br /> To run the program: ant run<br /> To build a distribution: ant dist</p>
