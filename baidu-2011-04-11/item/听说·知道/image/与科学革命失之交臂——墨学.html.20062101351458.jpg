<p>Should be a busy day and a busy week in the NFC South.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see what all four coaches have to say about Sunday&rsquo;s games in their Monday press conferences. I&rsquo;m particularly interested in hearing what Carolina coach John Fox has to say about his quarterback situation.</p>
<p>He implied Sunday that Jake Delhomme will remain the starter. But can you really stick with Delhomme after what&rsquo;s happened in his last two games? Then again, it&rsquo;s not like the Panthers have a choice. Backup Josh McCown got hurt and may be out for an extended period and I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s really an option to boost No. 3 quarterback Matt Moore to the starting role right now. The Panthers may have to sign a quarterback to take McCown&rsquo;s place. Jeff Garcia&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also curious to see if anything happens with Derrick Brooks on Monday or Tuesday. A team could sign him now and his salary wouldn&rsquo;t have to be guaranteed for the entire season. Something could happen with the Saints, but do they really need or want Brooks?</p>
<p>Speaking of the Saints, if anything is going to happen with possible suspensions for Will Smith and Charles Grant this week, the announcement will come Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>Some things on the horizon for later in the week: The NFC South chat is scheduled for Friday at 1 p.m. On Sunday, I&rsquo;ll be in Atlanta for the game between the Panthers and Falcons. Still talking back and forth with the folks in Bristol to figure out where I&#8217;ll go in Week Three, but that can wait until we get through Week Two.</p>

<p>The Carolina Panthers, desperate for help at defensive tackle made a run at Alfonso Boone, a league source said.</p>
<p>But Boone appears to be headed for San Diego, where he has history with defensive coordinator Ron Rivera.</p>
<p>That leaves the Panthers still looking for help. They lost Louis Leonard to a broken ankle Sunday and Nick Hayden sat out Sunday&rsquo;s game with a toe injury. Damione Lewis and Ra&rsquo;Shon Harris are the only healthy defensive tackles on the roster at the moment.</p>

<p>TAMPA, Fla. &#8212; Just a quick heads-up that the great Chris Mortensen will be pulling into One Buccaneer Place on Thursday as he nears the end of his training-camp tour.</p>
<p>Before I leave One Buc tonight, I&#039;ll make sure there&#039;s plenty of room in the parking lot for Mort&#039;s bus.</p>

				<p>Just realized that Friday&rsquo;s NFC South chat will be the final one of the regular season. With holidays falling on the following two Fridays, our usual window will be closed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll continue our chats through the postseason and the offseason. But if you&rsquo;ve got questions, try to join us Friday because it will be your last chance for a few weeks.</p>
<p>The chat starts at 1 p.m. ET. Here&rsquo;s the link to get there.</p>

<p>I know there&rsquo;s some skepticism and criticism in Tampa about the Buccaneers&rsquo; decision to leave for London on Friday morning while the Patriots are traveling Thursday night. Last year, the Saints left right after they played their game the previous Sunday and spent the whole week practicing on soccer fields.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the explanation coach Raheem Morris gave Wednesday:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an ownership group that goes over there pretty frequently and we talked about it, sat down and discussed it with those guys,&rsquo;&rsquo; Morris said. &ldquo;They feel the rest and how they feel prior to those days. They&#8217;ve done it a couple times. We have guys that go over there &#8212; our travel team has been over there &#8212; and they&#8217;re over there now getting used to it. It&#8217;s the second day when you feel bad. The third day you kind of go into a lull and then you come back out of it after that. We chose this route based on previous knowledge and some information from people that do it a lot. That&#8217;s the route we&#8217;re going.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The skepticism and criticism is based on the lingering theory the Glazer family that owns the team is trying to cut corners. Obviously, this route saves one night of hotel bills. I&rsquo;m not totally discounting that theory because there might be something to it.</p>
<p>But my question is this: Does it really matter when the Bucs go to London?</p>
<p>I mean, they could have gone over there in July, had training camp there, gotten used to the food and climate and even started to develop British accents and it wouldn&rsquo;t make a bit of difference.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re 0-6 and they&rsquo;re playing the Patriots.</p>

				<p>I&rsquo;d just like to take this opportunity to wish all of you happiness during the holiday season and thank you for being loyal and outstanding readers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a fun 2009 season and I&rsquo;m already looking forward to 2010. The blog will be kind of light today, but our weekly Final Word segment will go up late this afternoon. I&rsquo;ll have my cell phone on and won&rsquo;t be far from a computer, and I&rsquo;ll weigh in if there is any major NFC South news.</p>
<p>Our weekly Friday chats will resume once we get through the holidays. I&rsquo;ll be heading to New Orleans on Saturday to cover Sunday&rsquo;s game between the Buccaneers and Saints.</p>
<p>Again, best wishes to all during the holiday season.</p>

				<p><em>Posted by ESPN.com&rsquo;s Pat Yasinskas</em></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little update to the Clifton Smith-Dante Wesley story today.</p>
<p>Smith just met with reporters in Tampa for the first time since he suffered a concussion on a brutal and illegal hit by Carolina&rsquo;s Wesley on a punt during Sunday&rsquo;s game between the Panthers and Buccaneers. The NFL is punishing Wesley with a one-game suspension.</p>
<p>During his talk with the media, Smith revealed that Wesley called him to apologize. Smith said he accepted the apology.</p>
<p>Smith also said he expects to play in Sunday&rsquo;s game against the Patriots in London. That may turn out to be true, but it may be wishful thinking on the part of a competitive player. You can be sure the Tampa Bay medical staff is going to be very cautious before letting Smith back on the field. The Bucs have a bye after the New England game and, if there are any doubts about Smith&rsquo;s health, the Bucs will hold him out and let him get some more rest. With rookie Sammie Stroughter, the Bucs have a strong alternative in the return game.</p>

				<p><em>Posted by ESPN.com&rsquo;s Pat Yasinskas</em></p>
<p>I just got off the phone with Atlanta coach Mike Smith. Our conversation mostly was about a topic I&rsquo;ll be writing about Friday, but I took a couple of minutes at the end to go off track and ask Smith a couple of other questions.</p>
<p>One frequent question I&rsquo;ve been getting from a bunch of readers is, why don&rsquo;t the Falcons seem to be running the no-huddle offense as much as they did last year? I put the question to Smith and he pointed out that the Falcons probably have used the no-huddle offense at least as much as or more than  they did to this point last season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We started running no huddle in fourth game last year against Carolina,&rsquo;&rsquo; Smith said.</p>
<p>Smith acknowledged the Falcons may not seem like they&rsquo;re using that offense as much as they did later last year, but he said that&rsquo;s because of the defensive matchups they&rsquo;ve faced so far. He wouldn&rsquo;t rule out the possibility of the Falcons using more of the no-huddle system as the season goes on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something we discuss every week as a staff going into a game,&rsquo;&rsquo; Smith said. &ldquo;We determine how much, when and where and under what circumstances we&rsquo;re doing to run it. It really is done with a week-to-week analysis and a lot depends on who we&rsquo;re playing and their defense. If we feel it gives us an advantage, it will be in the game plan.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

				<p>NEW ORLEANS &#8212; If Bill Cowher returns to coaching, it very well may be in the NFC South.</p>
<p><!--INLINE MUG--></p>
<p><img class="floatright" src="/pic/0128174251977.jpg" alt="Cowher" width="65" height="90" /><span>Cowher</span><!--END INLINE MUG-->Adam Schefter and Chris Mortensen report Cowher is preparing to get back into coaching and has done some groundwork on assembling a coaching staff. There long has been speculation that Cowher could be a candidate for the Carolina job if John Fox is fired. Part of that is fueled by the fact Cowher lives in North Carolina.</p>
<p>But Schefter and Mortensen are reporting Tampa Bay could be a possibility for Cowher. First-year coach Raheem Morris has struggled.</p>
<p>The Glazer family, which owns the Buccaneers, has been criticized by fans for not spending big money in free agency. The Bucs still are paying former coach Jon Gruden and would have to pay Morris if he&rsquo;s fired.</p>
<p>Although Cowher is likely to command one of the league&rsquo;s highest salaries, the finances might not scare off the Buccaneers. The Glazers have made big splashes before, particularly when they hired Gruden, and they may view Cowher as the type of big name that can revive the franchise.</p>
