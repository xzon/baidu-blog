 Unit 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What's wrong with the students of today? Back when I was a student we had a better attitude!&quot; Criticisms like this are often heard from parents and teachers, in the news*****s and other media ?and it's been that way ever since education began. No matter what society or era you consider, there are always plenty of wise authorities pointing out that &quot;The students of today&quot; are somehow failing to grasp the true meaning of university education. Or maybe it's the other way around: Are universities failing to grasp the true meaning of students? The texts in this unit examine different aspects of this question. Text A discusses the many pressures that modern students face, while Texts B and C take a harder look at some basic misunderstandings about education and what a university is for.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 Directions: As you read Text B, try to predict the general direction of the author's thinking. There are a few questions inserted in the text to guide you -- be sure to answer them before you go on to the next section of the text. And remember: Being 100% accurate in your predictions isn't as important as the process of ****** predictions based on alert and active reading.

 College Lectures: Is Anybody Listening?
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A former teacher of mine, Robert A. Fowkes of New York University, likes to tell the story of a class he took in Old English while studying in Germany during the 1930s. On the first day the professor strode up to the blackboard, looked through his notes, coughed, and began, &quot;Guten Tag, Meine Damen und Herren&quot;(&quot;Good day, ladies and gentlemen&quot;). Fowkes glanced around uneasily. He was the only student in the course.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toward the middle of the semester, Fowkes fell ill and missed a class. When he returned, to Fowkes's astonishment, the professor began to deliver not the next lecture in the sequence but the one after. Had he, in fact, lectured to an empty hall in the absence of his solitary student? Fowkes thought it perfectly possible.
</div>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One aspect of American education too seldom challenged is the lecture system. Professors continue to lecture and students to take notes much as they did in the thirteenth century, when books were so scarce and expensive that few students could own them. The time is long overdue for us to abandon the lecture system and turn to methods that really work.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; One problem with lectures is that listening intelligently is hard work. Reading the same material in a textbook is a more efficient way to learn because students can proceed as slowly as they need to until the subject matter becomes clear to them. Even simply paying attention is very difficult: people can listen at a rate of four hundred to six hundred words a minute, while the most spirited professor talks at scarcely a third of that speed. This time lag between speech and comprehension leads to daydreaming. Many students believe years of watching television have shortened their attention span, but their real problem is that listening attentively is much harder than they think.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worse still, attending lectures is passive learning, at least for inexperienced listeners. Active learning, in which students write essays or perform experiments and then have their work evaluated by an instructor, is far more beneficial for those who have not yet fully learned how to learn. While it's true that techniques of active listening, such as trying to anticipate the speaker's next point or taking intelligent notes, can enhance the value of a lecture, few students possess such skills at the beginning of their college careers. More commonly, students try to write everything down and even bring tape recorders to class in a clumsy effort to capture every word.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students need to question their professors and to have their ideas taken seriously. Only then will they develop the analytical skills required to think intelligently and creatively. Most students learn best by engaging in frequent and even heated debate, not by taking down a professor's often unsatisfactory summary of complicated issues. They need small discussion classes that demand a joint effort of teacher and students rather than classes in which one person, however learned, expresses his or her own ideas.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lecture system ultimately harms professors as well. It reduces feedback to a minimum, so that the lecturer can neither judge how well students understand the material nor benefit from their questions or comments. Questions that require the speaker to clarify obscure points and comments that challenge inadequately constructed arguments are indispensable to scholarship. Without them, the liveliest mind becomes dull. Undergraduates may not be able to make good contributions very often, but by lecturing alone a professo* **ils to attract the beginner's ***** question that could have triggered a fruitful line of thought.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If lectures make so little sense, why have they been allowed to continue? Administrators love them of course. They can cram far more students into a lecture hall than into a discussion class, and for many administrators that's almost the end of the story. But the truth is that faculty members, and even students, conspire with them to keep the lecture system alive and well. Lectures are easier on everyone than debates. Professors can pretend to teach by lecturing just as students can pretend to learn by attending lectures, with no one the wiser, including the participants. Moreover, if lectures give some students an opportunity to sit back and let the professor run the show, they offer some professors an irresistible forum for showing off. In a classroom where everyone contributes, students are less able to hide and professors have less room to show off how smart they are.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lectures will never entirely disappear from the university scene, both because they seem to be economically necessary and because they spring from a long tradition in a setting that rightly values tradition for its own sake. But the lectures too frequently come at the wrong end of the students' educational careers -- during the first two years, when they most need close, even individual, instruction. If lecture classes were restricted to junior and senior undergraduates and to graduate students, who are more academically independent and more capable of working on their own, they would be far less destructive of students' interests and enthusiasms than the present system. After all, students must learn to listen before they can listen to learn.

 <br /> 大学讲课：有人在听吗？

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 我以前的一位老师，纽约大学的罗伯特&middot;A&middot;福克斯，喜欢讲述1930年代他在德国学习时上的一门古英语课程的故事。第一天，教授大步走向黑板，翻了翻笔记，清了清嗓门，然后开始上课，“Guten Tag, Meine Damen und Herren”（“白天好，女士们先生们”） 福克斯不安地看了看四周。他是这门课程唯一的学生。
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 临近期中，福克斯生病，缺了一次课。当他回来时，他惊奇地发现教授没有按顺序开始讲授下一课，而是讲再下面一课。难道在他唯一的学生缺席时他真的面对着空荡荡的大课堂讲过课了吗？福克斯认为这完全可能。
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 如今，美国的学院和大学（最初就是仿效德国大学的）正遭到严厉的抨击。人们指责老师们教得不好，学生们学得不好。美国的工商企业因管理人员缺乏创造性而受到损害，那些管理人员接受的教育不是去独立进行思考，而是去重复早已被世界上其它国家早就所抛弃的过时思想。大学毕业生们既缺乏基本技能也缺少一般的文化修养。关于高等教育的地位人们在进行研究，在发表报告，但由此而引起的变化要么主要是装装门面的，要么是使糟糕的事态变得更糟。
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 美国教育中一个很少受到质疑的方面就是讲课制度。就同十三世纪的时候一样教授们继续在讲课，学生们继续在记笔记，那时候书籍十分稀少昂贵，学生很少。我们早就该放弃讲课制度，转而采用向真正奏效的方法了。
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 讲课的一大问题在于开动脑筋听课决非易事。在教科书上阅读同样的材料是一种更为有效的学习方法，因为学生们可以根据需要慢慢阅读，直到他们明白主要内容为止。就是集中心思也很困难：人们能够以每分钟400到600个词的速度倾听，而精神最饱满的教授讲话的速度也难以达到这个速度的三分之一。讲与理解之间的这一时间差会使人分心想别的事。许多学生认为长年累月看电视已经缩短了他们注意力持续集中的时间，但他们真正的问题在于专心听讲比他们想象的要困难得多。
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 更糟糕的是，听课是消极学习，至少对于没有经验的听课者来说是这样。积极学习，即学生们写文章或做实验，然后让一位老师评估他们的作业，对那些还没有完全学会如何学习的学生来说要更为有益得多。虽然积极听课的技巧，如设法预期讲课人的下一点内容或者动脑筋记笔记，的确可以提高讲课的价值，但是几乎没有学生在大学学习之初就具备这样的技巧。更通常的情况是，学生们试图把一切都记下来，甚至把录音机带到课堂上来，笨拙地试图录下每一个字。
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 学生需要对教授的话提出异议，需要别人重视他们的想法。只有这样，他们才能逐步获得动脑筋、有创造的思维所需的分析技能。大多数学生学习的最佳途径是经常参加激烈的辩论，而不是记录教授对各种有争议的复杂问题所做的经常不尽如人意的总结。他们需要的是要求师生共同参与的小型讨论，而不是一个人表达自己观点的讲课，无论这个人多么有学问。
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 讲课制度最终也伤害到教授们。它使反馈量减到最低点，致使讲课者既无法判断学生们对教材的理解程度也无法从他们的问题或评论中受益。要求讲课人把模糊点讲清楚的问题和对于论据不足的论点提出质疑的评论对于做学问是必不可少的。没有它们，再活跃的头脑也会变得迟钝。大学本科生也许不会经常提出一些有价值的问题和评论，但是如果一人唱独角戏，教授便不能吸引初学者提出虽然幼稚但能引发出有效思路的问题。
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 如果讲课这样没有意义，那为什么还一直允许它们继续存在呢？管理人员当然喜欢它们。比起讨论课来，他们能把多得多的学生塞进一个大课堂。对许多管理人员来说，这几乎就是他们工作的结束了。但事实是教员们，甚至学生们，与他们共谋来使讲课体系继续存在、长盛不衰。讲课对每个人来说都比辩论更容易。教授们可以通过讲课假装在教，正像学生可以通过听课假装在学一样，而这一点谁都没察觉，包括参与者在内。而且，如果说讲课给一些学生提供了一个往座位上一靠，让教授指挥一切的机会，那么它们也给一些教授提供了一个自我卖弄的诱人舞台。在一个人人参与的教室里，学生们躲避的机会要少了，教授们炫耀知识的余地也要少。
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 讲课永远不会从大学的舞台上完全消失，一方面因为从经济角度考虑它们似乎是必需的，另一方面也因为它们来源于一个久远的传统，而大学这个环境为了其自身利益又理所当然地尊重传统。但是，讲课却过于经常地出现在学生学习生涯中的不恰当阶段——在最初的两年，而这时他们最需要的是只限于少数人的，甚至是一对一的教学。如果讲课局限于在学业上更有主见、更能独立学习的三四年级本科生或者研究生，它们对学生兴趣和热情的破坏会比现有的制度小得多。毕竟，学生必须先学会听然后才能在听中学。
