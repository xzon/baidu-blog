 The Tide is high but I'm holding on.
 <br /> I'm gonna be your number one.
 <br /> I'm not that kinda girl
 <br /> Who gives up just like that oh no!
 <br /> It's not the things you do
 <br /> That tease and hurt me bad
 <br /> But it's the way you do
 <br /> The things you do to me.
 <br /> I'm not the kinda girl
 <br /> Who gives up just like that, oh no.
 <br /> The tide is high but I'm holding on.
 <br /> I'm gonna be your number one.
 <br /> The tide is high but I'm holding on.
 <br /> I'm gonna be your number one.
 <br /> Number one.
 <br /> Oh no
 <br /> Number one
 <br /> Every girl wants you to be her man
 <br /> But I'll wait, my dear, 'till it's my turn.
 <br /> I'm not the kinda girl
 <br /> Who gives up just like that, oh no.
 <br /> The tide is high but I'm holding on.
 <br /> I'm gonna be your number one.
 <br /> The tide is high but I'm holding on.
 <br /> I'm gonna be your number one.
 <br /> Number one.
 <br /> Oh no
 <br /> Number one.
 <br /> Everytime that I get the feeling
 <br /> You give me somthing to believe in
 <br /> Everytime that I got you near me
 <br /> I know the way that I want it to be
 <br /> But you know I'm gonna take my chance now
 <br /> I'm gonna make it happen somehow
 <br /> And you know I can take the pressure
 <br /> I'm moment to wait for a lifetimes pleasure
