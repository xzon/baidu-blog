 It's another day at school
 <br />And he's just walking out the door
 <br />Got his rucksack on his back
 <br />And his feet dragging on the floor
 <br />Always late for when he's questioned
 <br />He can't think of what to say
 <br />Hides the bruises from the teachers
 <br />Hoping that they go away
 <br />Even though his mom and dad
 <br />They both got problems of their own
 <br />Caught a catch at 22
 <br />But he'd still rather be at home
 <br />Cries himself to sleep and prays
 <br />When he wakes up things might have changed
 <br />But everything's still the same
 <br />But didn't you say
 <br />You always said that I should speak up hmm
 <br />But it seems like all the things
 <br />You said to me before meant nothing at all
 <br />Because
 <br />I keep telling you that Johnny's hitting me
 <br />That's why I'm late for school
 <br />(But you never listen)
 <br />Instead you always seem to end up blaming me
 <br />For things I didn't do
 <br />(For what it's worth)
 <br />I didn't even want to tell you anything
 <br />In case it made things worse
 <br />(Just so you know)
 <br />Everytime I say that Johnny's hitting me
 <br />Hey mom and dad it hurts
 <br />Every day keeps on repeating
 <br />Like the record on replay
 <br />Slowly getting off the bus
 <br />With Johnny waiting at the gates
 <br />Like a friend who will smile
 <br />And wave at him or calling out his name
 <br />Put his arm around his neck
 <br />Whisper &quot;now give me all your change!&quot;
 <br />To afraid to make a scene
 <br />Or plea with him to letting go
 <br />He just takes whatever's coming
 <br />Feels the pain with every blow
 <br />Tries in vain to make himself be heard
 <br />As soon as he gets home
 <br />But everything's still the same
 <br />But didn't you say
 <br />You always said that I should speak up hmm
 <br />But it seems like all the things
 <br />You said to me before meant nothing at all
 <br />Because
 <br />I keep telling you that Johnny's hitting me
 <br />That's why I'm late for school
 <br />(But you never listen)
 <br />Instead you always seem to end up blaming me
 <br />For things I didn't do
 <br />(For what it's worth)
 <br />I didn't even want to tell you anything
 <br />In case it made things worse
 <br />(Just so you know)
 <br />Everytime I say that Johnny's hitting me
 <br />Hey mom and dad it hurts
 <br />You always said that I should speak up hmm
 <br />And to never be afraid to come
 <br />And tell you if I needed to talk
 <br />(If I needed to talk, yeh)
 <br />Well I don't know the meaning of love hmm
 <br />'Cos it seems like all the things you said to me
 <br />Before meant nothing at all
 <br />Because
 <br />I keep telling you that Johnny's hitting me
 <br />That's why I'm late for school
 <br />(But you never listen)
 <br />Instead you always seem to end up blaming me
 <br />For things I didn't do
 <br />(For what it's worth)

 <br />I keep telling you that Johnny's hitting me
 <br />That's why I'm late for school
 <br />(But you never listen)
 <br />Instead you always seem to end up blaming me
 <br />For things I didn't do
 <br />(For what it's worth)
