 Ohh wooaah (3x)
 <br />You know you love me,I know you care
 <br />You shout whenever, And I'll be there
 <br />You want my love, You want my heart
 <br />And we will never ever ever be apart
 <br />Are we an item? Girl quit playing
 <br />Were just friends, Or are we saying
 <br />So theres another one, Looks right in my eyes
 <br />My first love broke my heart for the first time,
 <br />And I was like
 <br />Baby, baby, baby nooo
 <br />My baby, baby, baby noo
 <br />My baby, baby, baby nooo
 <br />I thought youd always be mine mine
 <br />Baby, baby, baby nooo
 <br />My baby, baby, baby noo
 <br />My baby, baby, baby nooo
 <br />I thought youd always be mine, oh oh
 <br />For you, I would have done whatever
 <br />Another chance and we, We get together
 <br />And wanna play it cool, About loosin' you
 <br />I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
 <br />And i'm in piece , baby fix me
 <br />And you'll shake me til' you wake me from this bad dream
 <br />Im going down, down, dooown
 <br />And just can't believe my first love won't be around
 <br />Baby, baby, baby nooo
 <br />Baby, baby, baby nooo
 <br />My baby, baby, baby noo
 <br />My baby, baby, baby nooo
 <br />I thought youd always be mine
 <br />When i was 13 i had my first love
 <br />Here was nobody to compare my baby
 <br />And nobody came between us or could ever come above
 <br />She had me goin crazy
 <br />Oh i was starstruck.
 <br />She woke me up daily dont need no starbucks
 <br />She made my heart pound
 <br />Asking for a beat when i see her in the street
 <br />And in the school on the playground
 <br />But i really wanna see her on the weekends
 <br />She knows she got me dazy
 <br />Cause she was so amazing and now my heart is breaking
 <br />But i just keep on sayin
 <br />Baby, baby, baby nooo
 <br />My baby, baby, baby noo
 <br />My baby, baby, baby nooo
 <br />I thought youd always be mine x2
 <br />Now Im all gone
