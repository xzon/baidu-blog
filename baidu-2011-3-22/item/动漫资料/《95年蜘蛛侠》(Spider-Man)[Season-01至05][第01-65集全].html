 <h1>《95年蜘蛛侠》(Spider-Man)[Season-01至05][第01-65集全]</h1> 
 <p><br /> Imagine being able to sense danger, crawl any wall, be strong enough to bend steel, and have more agility than any other human? For Peter Parker, this is a fact. Except he doesn't think of it as a gift.<br /> <br /> In his final year of High School, Peter Parker was bitten by an irradiated spider. After brief hallucinations, Peter wakes up with incredible powers--much like that of a spider. Thus, to make some extra cash, Peter takes on the persona of Spider-Man, and tries to pursue a career as a pro wrestler. When he witnesses a robbery, he lets the criminal escape, simply because &quot;it's not his problem&quot;. Then, when his dear Uncle Ben is killed, Peter finds that the murderer is none other than the criminal he failed to stop before.<br /> <br /> Now, Peter uses his powers to stop crime, as he learns that &quot;With great power, comes great responibility&quot;.<br /> <br /> Beginning in November of 1994, John Semper and crew launched the most accurate portrayal of Peter Parker to be animated to date. Where previous animated incarnations focused on action, this version provided the same three dimensional Peter Parker found in the comics.<br /> <br /> Complete with the familiar supporting cast, a hapless lovelife, doting Aunt May, and grumpy J. Jonah Jameson, the show places Peter during his college years at ESU. <br /> <br /> In the 65 episodes, Spidey faced almost all of the major Spidey villains, old and new (except for the absence of the Sandman). Even the comic's second stringers like Rocket Racer, Madame Web, and the Prowler have appeared on the show!<br /> <br /> It was later followed by the somewhat weaker, short lived series Spider-Man Unlimited, which followed Spidey's adventures on counterearth.<br /> <br /> Spider-Man Airing Times <br /> <br /> Saturdays at 11:00am on ABC Family <br /> Every Night at 10:30pm on Toon Disney<br /> <br /> Each episode airs in their order of production, not original airdate. Therefore, the reruns are all in the correct order.<br /> <br /> Spider-Man is currently part of Disney's new Jetix block.<br /> <br /> Note: These times are for the US only, in Eastern Time Zone. <br /> <br /> <br /> 【人物介绍】<br /> <br /> Peter Parker/Spider-Man: Peter is a kind of shy and quiet guy. He's a science-wiz, and he has a crush on his best friend Mary-Jane Watson. Peter also works for the Daily Bugle, a local newspaper, for minimum wage. But whenever trouble calls, he transforms into his web-slinging alter-ego Spider-Man. As Spidey, he has the power to sense danger, crawl walls, has super strength and super agility, and is armed with spider tracers, a powerful light on his belt, and artificial webbing.<br /> <br /> Mary-Jane Watson: MJ is a gorgeous red head that has always lived next door to Peter, but doesn't actually meet him until their blind date. After breif on-again off-again relationships with both Peter and Harry Osborn, she eventually marries Peter. Unfortunately, after a battle with the Green Goblin, she disappears, and the one who returns may not necessarily be who she thinks she is. Although she's always the enemies' first target, she remains safe due to the work of Spider-Man.<br /> <br /> Aunt May: Aunt May is Peter's elderly aunt. She's been taking care of Peter since his parents passed away when he was young. She always supports Peter when he is in need, and Peter does the same.<br /> <br /> J. Jonah Jameson: Old JJ is the grumpy-yet-quick witted editor of the Daily Bugle. For some reason, he has always hated Spidey, considering him a &quot;menace&quot;. Eventually, it is revealed that his wife was gunned down by a masked man, which may explain his hate toward Spider-Man--a masked man. He also has a son, John Jameson, an astronaut.<br /> <br /> Felicia Hardy/Black Cat: Felicia began as the rich and sometimes spoiled daughter of the Hardys'. She and Peter once dated (pretty impressive on Peter's part), but her life changed dramatically when she discovered that her dad was once a spy called &quot;The Cat&quot;. When she got involved with his past, she was caught in an experiment that trasformed her into an agile, strong beauty called &quot;The Black Cat&quot;. She now occasionally accompanies Spidey whenever he needs her, but her real interest is her love Micheal Morbius, who now fights vampires alongside Blade.<br /> <br /> Harry Osborn: Wealthy son of industrialist Norman Osborn, Harry is one of Peter's best friends. He seems somewhat wimpy at first, but he has dark secrets. He has dated Mary-Jane and shared an apartment with Peter. He later becomes the next Green Goblin (see below).<br /> <br /> Robbie Robertson: Robbie works at the Bugle with Peter, and is JJ's right hand man. He is married with one son, who occasionally gets in trouble, but overall he has a happy, strong family. Despite his boss's beliefs, he always stands up for both Spidey and Peter.<br /> <br /> Dr. Curt Connors: Dr. Connors is a brilliant scientist who works with neogenics. Because of a war injury, he only has one arm. He always helps Spidey when in need, sometimes even when he may be in danger. He has a wife and one young son, both of which who have his back. Dr. Connors also shares the alterrnate identity as the Lizard (see below).<br /> <br /> 敌人介绍<br /> <br /> Dr. Otto Octavius/Dr. Octopus: Dr. Otto was a very good and smart scientist, but when and experiment goes wrong he becomes eight-handed Dr. Octopus. He is one of Spider-Man's most deadly villains.<br /> <br /> Wilson Fisk/Kingpin: Wilson Fisk is the notorious crime-boss also known as Kingpin. He is cause of almost everything that is going wrong when he is around. Him and his &quot;Henchmen&quot; will do anything to destroy Spider-Man.<br /> <br /> Eddie Brock/Venom: Eddie Brock used to be the Daily Bugle's best reporters, that is, until Spider-Man continued to humiliate him. He was subsequently fired from his job and blamed Spider-Man for it. Later, Brock comes in contact with Spider-Man's black costume and takes on the new persona of Venom. As Venom, Brock possesses all of Spider-Man's powers, minus spider-sense, but to a much higher degree.<br /> <br /> Cletus Kassidy/Carnage: When Venom's symbiote spawned, it found the perfect owner: serial killer/psychopath Cletus Kassidy. Kassidy's insane mind is what powers the almost invincible alter-ego of Carnage. Though he has most of the same weaknesses of Venom, his powers involve morphing his hands into blades, shooting out sharp symbiote knives, and much more. He enjoys agitating Venom by calling him &quot;Dad&quot;. <br /> <br /> Norman Osborn/Green Goblin I: Norman is the wealthy industrialist that owns &quot;Oscorp&quot;. He has a rigid relationship with his son, Harry. After being exposed to toxic chemicals, Norman gains enhanced strength, but the chemicals also cause his sanity to erode away. When he becomes paranoid and close to insane, he dawns the Green Goblin armor, a hi-tech suit equipped with super bombs, a powerful glider, a who knows what else. He is one of Spider-Man's toughest foes, mainly emotionally, because his son is one of Peter's best friends.<br /> <br /> Harry Osborn/Green Goblin II: After the disappearance of his father, Harry is haunted by nightmares and hallucinations--and his inner demons are released. Somehow his father reaches him from the other dimension, and leads him to the Goblin gear, where he becomes the next Green Goblin, with the same suit and technology as the previous one. He blames Spider-Man for the &quot;death&quot; of his father, and will stop at nothing to get revenge.<br /> <br /> Mac Gargan/The Scorpion: Mac Gargan was hired by Jameson to spy on Peter Parker to find out how he gets those spectacular shots of Spider-Man. After failing miserably at it, Jameson comes up with a better use for Gargan...by subjecting him to a process similar to how Spider-Man got his powers. Gargan was bombarded by radiation and scorpion DNA, and emerged as the natural enemy of the spider. Thus, the Scorpion was born. The radiation began to slowly drive the Scorpion mad, and now seeks a way to turn himself back to normal.<br /> <br /> Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard: After trying to grow his severed arm back by using Lizard DNA, Dr. Connors accidentally transforms himself into the ravenous, bloodthirsty, Lizard monster. Now he transforms into it whenever he is angry, but as long as he stays calm, he can control the beast within. <br /> <br /> <br /> 【官方网站】<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 【STAFF】<br /> <br /> Edward Asner Role: J. Jonah Jameson <br /> Yitzak Edward Asner was born on November 15, 1929 in Kansas City, Kansas. Versatile, committed, eloquent, and talented: all these adjectives describe actor/activist Edward Asner.
