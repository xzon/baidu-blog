<p>&quot;You will be mule, working constantly from dusk to dawn, carrying heavy loads on your back. <br /> You will eat grass and you lack intelligence. You will live for 40 years.&quot; <br /> The mule answered, &quot;To live like this for 40 years is too much. <br /> Please, give me no more than 20.&quot; And it was so. <br /> Then God created the dog, and told him, &quot;You will hold vigilance over thedwellings of Man, to whom you will be his greatest companion. <br /> You will eat his table scraps and live for 30 years.&quot; And the dog responded, <br /> &quot;Lord, to live 30 years as a dog is too much. Please, no more than 15 years.&quot; <br /> And it was so.God then created the monkey, and told him, <br /> &quot;You are Monkey. You shallswing from tree to tree, acting like an idiot. <br /> You will be funny, and you shall live for 20 years.&quot; And the monkey responded, <br /> &quot;Lord, to live 20 years as the clown of the world is too much. <br /> Please, Lord, give me no more than 10 years.&quot; And it was so. <br /> Finally, God created Man and told him, &quot;You are Man, the only rational being that walks the earth. <br /> You will use your intelligence to have mastery over the creatures of the world. <br /> You will dominate the earth and live for20 years.&quot;And the man responded, <br /> &quot;Lord, to be Man for only 20 years is too little. <br /> Please, Lord, give me the 20 years the mule refused, the 15 years the dog refused, <br /> and the 10 years the monkey rejected.&quot; And it was so. <br /> And so God made Man to live 20 years as a man, <br /> then marry and live 20years like a mule working and carrying heavy loads on his back. <br /> Then, he is to have children and live 15 years as a dog, guarding his house <br /> and eating the leftovers after they empty the pantry; then, in his old age, <br /> to live 10 years as a monkey, acting like a clown to amuse his grandchildren.</p>
