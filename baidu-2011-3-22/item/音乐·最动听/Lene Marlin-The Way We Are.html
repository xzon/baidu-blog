 I watch you growing sometimes
 <br /> I see myself - in you
 <br /> It can be scary but kinda funny too
 <br /> Ahh......
 <br /> I hear you talking
 <br /> A lot of similarities
 <br /> Your choice of words
 <br /> And all the fantasises
 <br /> Just the way we are
 <br /> I guess you've seen it now
 <br /> A mirror of ourselves sure makes us weird
 <br /> Falling down
 <br /> From a mountain of frights
 <br /> What's there to hold on to?
 <br /> The way you makes all smile
 <br /> and the despair when you just
 <br /> Won't go to sleep
 <br /> You could have me walking a mile
 <br /> to make you smile still it's not
 <br /> really a weep
 <br /> Ahh......
 <br /> I know you fooled me
 <br /> A million times
 <br /> I just can't help it
 <br /> Don't know why
 <br /> Just the way we are
 <br /> I guess you've seen it now
 <br /> A mirror of ourselves sure makes us weird
 <br /> Falling down
 <br /> From a mountain of frights
 <br /> What's there to hold on to?
 <br /> I know you hate it but they really have to do
 <br /> What they do
 <br /> You're crying out your wishes I understand
 <br /> Yet they don't have a clue.
 <br /> Just the way we are
 <br /> I guess you've seen it now
 <br /> A mirror of ourselves sure makes us weird
 <br /> Falling down
 <br /> From a mountain of frights
 <br /> What's there to hold on to?
 <br /> Falling down
 <br /> From a mountain of frights
 <br /> What's there to hold on to?
