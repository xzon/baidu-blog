 <p>Nothing in the world （中文歌词）</p> 
 <p>&quot;Ladies's Night&quot;</p> 
</div> 
<div> 
</div> 
<div>
 It's been so long I can't remember when
 <br /> We didn't care how deep it was we dived right in
 <br /> Watching everything around us disappear
 <br /> Oh I've missed you here
</div> 
<div> 
</div> 
<div>
 And it seems the little things get in the way
 <br /> We're so caught up in routine from day to day
 <br /> Sometimes it feels like we're not anchored anywhere
 <br /> Oh I've missed you yeah
 <br /> So tell me there's nothing in the world
 <br /> That could ever come between us
 <br /> Show me your not afraid tonight Baby make me believe
 <br /> That there's nothing in the world
 <br /> That could ever
 <br /> steal the moment from right here and now
 <br /> (nothing)
 <br /> Nothing
 <br /> in the world
</div> 
<div> 
</div> 
<div>
 Two shadows falling back together now
 <br /> Baby we've spent too much time just hiding out
 <br /> And there's nowhere that I'd rather be than here
 <br /> Cos I've missed you yeah
 <br /> So tell me there's nothing in the world
 <br /> That could ever come between us
 <br /> Show me your not afraid tonight Baby make me believe
 <br /> That there's nothing in the world
 <br /> That could ever
 <br /> steal the moment from right here and now
 <br /> (nothing)
 <br /> Nothing
 <br /> in the world
 <br /> Nothing in the world
 <br /> (in the world)
 <br /> There's nothing in the world
 <br /> So tell me there's nothing in the world
 <br /> That could ever come between us
 <br /> Show me your not afraid tonight Baby make me believe
 <br /> That there's nothing in the world
 <br /> That could ever
 <br /> steal the moment from right here and now
 <br /> (nothing)
 <br /> Nothing
 <br /> So tell me there's nothing in the world
 <br /> That could ever come between us
 <br /> Show me your not afraid tonight Baby make me believe
 <br /> That there's nothing in the world
 <br /> That could ever
 <br /> steal the moment from right here and now
 <br /> (nothing)
 <br /> So tell me there's nothing in the world
 <br /> That could ever come between us
 <br /> Show me your not afraid tonight Baby make me believe
 <br /> That there's nothing in the world

 我已经很久没有注意到我们有陷得多深 
 <br /> 眼睁睁地看着身边的所有东西消失 
 <br /> 我已经在这里错过了你 
 <br /> 
 <br /> 这看上去似乎有很多小事挡在路上 
 <br /> 我们每天像例行公事一般去弥补 
 <br /> 有时就感觉到我们的任何一个地方都是不固定的 
 <br /> 我已经错过了你 
 <br /> 
 <br /> 告诉我世界上没有什么东西能介入我们之间 
 <br /> 像我展示今晚你并不担心 
 <br /> 亲爱的，请使我相信世界上没有东西能偷走从现在开始的这一刻 
 <br /> 没有...世上没有东西 
 <br /> 
 <br /> 两个影子正在退却 
 <br /> 亲爱的我们用了太多的时间躲藏 
 <br /> 然而没有一地方能比这里更让我钟爱 
 <br /> 我已经错过了你 
 <br /> 
 <br /> 告诉我世界上没有什么东西能介入我们之间 
 <br /> 像我展示今晚你并不担心 
 <br /> 亲爱的，请使我相信世界上没有东西能偷走从现在开始的这一刻 
 <br /> 没有...世上没有东西
