T-bag: You think you are the only one who feels betrayed? I…loved you, Susan. Real love. For the first time in my life... And then…and then what you do to me like that just throw me back into the dark and toss me out of the back door...I have sins in the past. But when I met you, the person, that one who did all the terrible things, he died. And I was reborn. By the grace of your love I was a new man, a better man. When you sent me here to this place with these people, you bring that dirty bastard right home. <br>
你认为只有你觉得被人背叛了吗？我。。。曾经爱过你，Susan. 我生命中的第一次真爱。而你。。而你所做的，却是把我扫地出门，重新赶回黑暗之中。我过去是有过罪恶，但当我遇见你的那一刻，那个做尽坏事的人就已经死了，而我则获得了重生。在你爱情的光辉中，我成了一个新的人，一个更好的人。当你把我送进这里，与这些人为伍时，过去那个肮脏的罪人又将复活。 <br>
天堂与地狱的一线之隔，原来是爱。 <br>
