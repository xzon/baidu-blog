<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Ever wondered which program has a particular file or directory open? Now you can find out. <em>Process Explorer</em> shows you information about which handles and DLLs processes have opened or loaded.</p>
<p>The <em>Process Explorer</em> display consists of two sub-windows. The top window always shows a list of the currently active processes, including the names of their owning accounts, whereas the information displayed in the bottom window depends on the mode that <em>Process Explorer</em> is in: if it is in handle mode you'll see the handles that the process selected in the top window has opened; if <em>Process Explorer</em> is in DLL mode you'll see the DLLs and memory-mapped files that the process has loaded. <em>Process Explorer</em> also has a powerful search capability that will quickly show you which processes have particular handles opened or DLLs loaded.</p>
<p>The unique capabilities of <em>Process Explorer</em> make it useful for tracking down DLL-version problems or handle leaks, and provide insight into the way Windows and applications work.</p>
