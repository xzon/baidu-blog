<div> </div>
<div>This is a quick start to MiG Layout. For further information look at <a href="http://www.migcomponents.com/">www.migcomponents.com</a> as it will be <br>
updated with links to the new and relevant information.<br>
To start using MiG Layout all you need to do is to download the miglayout.jar and include it in your project or <br>
classpath. There are different versions for Swing and SWT, but they work exactly the same. There is also a <br>
version for JSE 1.5 and one for 1.4 where the latter has varargs support in the API.<br>
Adding Components to the Grid<br>
Adding components to a Container is as simple as writing text and follows the same basic principle. If you <br>
just add them they will end up on the same row. When you want to change to next row you specify the <br>
constraint &quot;wrap&quot; and the next component will be on the next row. For example:<br>
panel.add(comp1)<br>
panel.add(comp2)<br>
panel.add(comp3, &quot;wrap&quot;)&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Wrap to next row<br>
panel.add(comp4)<br>
comp1 comp2 comp3<br>
comp4<br>
The grid can also be set to auto wrap at a specific column index by specifying that in the layout constraint <br>
when creating the layout manager. Next shows how to create the same grid without having to specify the <br>
&quot;wrap&quot; when adding comp3. It means that the grid should auto wrap after column 3 and there will thus not be <br>
a fourth column.<br>
MigLayout layout = new MigLayout(&quot;wrap 3&quot;);<br>
From v2.5 the next row's gap can be set directly after the wrap keyword. E.g:<br>
panel.add(comp3, &quot;wrap 15&quot;)<br>
will make the row gap 15 pixels high. You can even make the gap &quot;pushing&quot; by specifying for instance &quot;wrap <br>
push&quot;.<br>
Merging and Splitting Cells<br>
It is equally easy to split or span cells. Here is how to create the next grid.<br>
panel.add(comp1)<br>
panel.add(comp2, &quot;span 2&quot;) // The component will span two cells.<br>
panel.add(comp3, &quot;wrap&quot;)&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Wrap to next row <br>
panel.add(comp4, &quot;span&quot;)&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Span without &quot;count&quot; means span whole row.<br>
comp1 comp2 comp3<br>
comp4<br>
Span optinally takes two indexes, x and y. This means that you can span cells like this:<br>
-1<br>
panel.add(comp1);<br>
panel.add(comp2, &quot;span 2 2&quot;); // The component will span 2x2 cells.<br>
panel.add(comp3, &quot;wrap&quot;);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Wrap to next row <br>
panel.add(comp4);<br>
panel.add(comp5);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Note that it &quot;jumps over&quot; the occupied cells.<br>
panel.add(comp6);<br>
panel.add(comp7);<br>
comp1<br>
comp4<br>
comp2<br>
comp3<br>
comp5<br>
comp6 comp7<br>
It is equally easy and intuitive to split cells.<br>
panel.add(comp1);<br>
panel.add(comp2, &quot;split 2&quot;); // Split the cell in two<br>
panel.add(comp3);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Will be in same cell as previous<br>
panel.add(comp4, &quot;wrap&quot;);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Wrap to next row<br>
panel.add(comp5);<br>
comp1 comp2 comp3 comp4<br>
comp5<br>
It is of course possible to both span and split cells at the same time. You can for instance span three cells <br>
and split that three-cell-wide cell into two.<br>
Using Absolute Cell Coordinates<br>
If you don't want to use the &quot;flow&quot; way to put components into grid positions you can instead use absolute <br>
coordinates. For instance:<br>
panel.add(comp1, &quot;cell 0 0&quot;); // &quot;cell column row&quot;<br>
panel.add(comp2, &quot;cell 1 0&quot;);<br>
panel.add(comp3, &quot;cell 2 0&quot;);<br>
panel.add(comp4, &quot;cell 0 1&quot;);<br>
Would produce the same grid as the first example at the top.<br>
comp1 comp2 comp3<br>
comp4<br>
You can also use the absolute cell way to span and split cells. If a component is put in a cell that already has <br>
a component the cell will be split and both cells will end up in the same cell, sharing its space. To make the <br>
same grid as the second example above you do like this:<br>
-2<br>
panel.add(comp1, &quot;cell 0 0&quot;);<br>
panel.add(comp2, &quot;cell 0 0 2 1&quot;); // &quot;cell column row width height&quot;<br>
panel.add(comp3, &quot;cell 3 0&quot;);<br>
panel.add(comp4, &quot;cell 0 1 4 1&quot;);<br>
comp1 comp2 comp3<br>
comp4<br>
Specifying Gaps<br>
Generally gaps are added where they make sense and this is performed on a platform by platform basis. For <br>
instance Mac OS X will have bigger gaps than Windows or Linux in general. There are two kinds of gaps. <br>
Grid row gaps and Component gaps. They default to proper values but you can change them however you <br>
like.<br>
Grid gaps<br>
In the grid illustrations above they are the small spacing columns and rows between the real columns and <br>
rows. Their size can be set in the column and rows constraints when creating the layout manager (or set on <br>
the layout manager object afterwards). E.g.<br>
MigLayout layout = new MigLayout(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;&quot;,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Layout Constraints<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;[][]20[]&quot;,&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Column constraints<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;[]20[]&quot;);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Row constraints<br>
would create something like this:<br>
comp1 comp2 comp3<br>
comp4<br>
where the bigger spacing row and column is 20 pixels. You can of course use any unit to specify the size but <br>
the default default is pixels (you can change this though). For instance &quot;20mm&quot; will make it 20 millimeters <br>
wide.<br>
Note that from 2.5 you can specify the gap when using the &quot;wrap&quot; keyword. E.g. &quot;wrap 15px&quot;<br>
The space between the square brackets [ (here..) ] is the place where you specify the row and component <br>
constraints such as alignment and size. More on this later.<br>
Component gaps<br>
The only situation where there is a default component gap &gt; 0 is between components in the same (thus <br>
split) cell. You can however change this by specifying a gap size when adding the component. Gaps around <br>
components is the distance to the closest edge, may it be the cell &quot;wall&quot; or another component in the same <br>
cell. If we use the first example this is how it would be:<br>
panel.add(comp1)<br>
panel.add(comp2, &quot;gapleft 30&quot;)<br>
-3<br>
panel.add(comp3, &quot;wrap&quot;)&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Wrap to next row<br>
panel.add(comp4)<br>
comp1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  comp2 comp3<br>
comp4<br>
There are many gap constraints, for instance &quot;gapbefore&quot; and &quot;gaptop&quot;. You can read about them in <br>
the Cheat Sheet or White Paper on <a href="http://www.migcomponents.com/">www.migcomponents.com</a>.<br>
Component Sizes<br>
Components have sizes provided by the GUI framework in some way. Swing even have support for <br>
minimum/preferred/maximum size while SWT only has a preferred size. You can override these sizes and for <br>
SWT even extend the functionality by providing the sizes in the constraints. The sizes are specified in the <br>
form: &quot;min:preferred:max&quot; (E.g. &quot;10:20:40&quot;). A size not specified will default to the component's <br>
corresponding size (E.g. &quot;10::40&quot; will set the min and max size but preserve the original preferred size). <br>
There are a lot of short ways to set the sizes, for instance &quot;40!&quot; means that all three sizes will be set to 40. <br>
Examples:<br>
panel.add(comp, &quot;width 10:20:40&quot;);<br>
panel.add(comp, &quot;height ::40&quot;);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Same as &quot;hmax 40&quot;.<br>
panel.add(comp, &quot;w 40!&quot;);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // w is short for width.<br>
Row and Column sizes<br>
Rows and columns default to the size of the largest component in the column/row. This can be overridden <br>
and it works exactly the same ways as the component sizes above. You specify the column/row size in the <br>
corresponding constraint, normally when creating the layout manager. Here are some examples:<br>
MigLayout layout = new MigLayout(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;&quot;,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Layout Constraints<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;[10][20:30:40][40!][::40]&quot;,&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Column constraints<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;[min!][10::20][40mm!]&quot;);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Row constraints<br>
Did you see the &quot;min!&quot; part? &quot;min&quot;, &quot;pref&quot;, &quot;max&quot; can be used on both component and column/row <br>
sizes to refer to the original size. So &quot;min!&quot; means that minimum, preferred and maximum size will all be <br>
set to the minimum size of the row, ensuring the row will for sure get its minimum size.<br>
Panel Insets<br>
By default there will be an invisible border around the layout, except if you have docking components. The <br>
size of it is different on different platforms. Sometimes this is not what you want or you just want to specify <br>
-4<br>
another inset. You can change this in the layout constraint. Examples:<br>
MigLayout layout = new MigLayout(&quot;insets 10&quot;);<br>
MigLayout layout = new MigLayout(&quot;insets 0 10 10 20&quot;); // T, L, B, R.<br>
Component Alignment<br>
Components that are alone in a cell can be aligned within that cell, if there is space over. You can specify <br>
this in the column/row constraints to get a default align for the components and/or you can specify it in the <br>
component's constraints.<br>
MigLayout layout = new MigLayout(<br>
&quot;&quot;,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Layout Constraints<br>
&quot;[center][right][left][c]&quot;, // Column constraints with default align<br>
&quot;[top][center][b]&quot;);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Row constraints with default align<br>
and/or when you add the components:<br>
panel.add(comp, &quot;align left&quot;);<br>
Note that you can use the first letter of the alignment if you prefer.<br>
If you have more than one component in a cell the alignment keywords will not work since the behavior <br>
would be indeterministic. You can however accomplish the same thing by setting a gap before and/or after <br>
the components. That gap may have a minimum size of 0 and a preferred size of a really large value to <br>
create a &quot;pushing&quot; gap. There is even a keyword for this: &quot;push&quot;. So &quot;gapleft push&quot; will be the same as <br>
&quot;align right&quot; and work for multi-component cells as well.<br>
Docking Components<br>
You can dock components much like how BorderLayout in Swing works, except you aren't confined to use <br>
only one component per side and a predefined usage of the corners. The docking components is always <br>
placed outside the normal layout. You can mix grid and docking components in the same layout.<br>
panel.add(comp1)<br>
panel.add(comp2)<br>
panel.add(comp3, &quot;wrap&quot;)&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Wrap to next row<br>
panel.add(comp4)<br>
panel.add(comp1N, &quot;dock north&quot;)<br>
panel.add(comp2W, &quot;dock west&quot;)<br>
panel.add(comp3S, &quot;dock south&quot;)<br>
panel.add(comp4E, &quot;east&quot;) // &quot;dock&quot; keyword are actually optional<br>
-5<br>
comp1N<br>
comp2W comp1 comp2 comp3<br>
comp4<br>
comp4E<br>
comp3S<br>
Note that a docked component &quot;cuts off&quot; that part which means that the ordering of the docking components <br>
is important for how the corners are used. If the comp4E component was moved first in the code the table <br>
would look like this instead:<br>
comp1N<br>
comp2W comp1 comp2 comp3<br>
comp4<br>
comp3S<br>
comp4E<br>
Docking components is a very good and easy way to layout panels but its usages are many. You can get <br>
spacing around the docking components by using normal Component Gaps as described above.<br>
Growing and Shrinking Components Depending on Available Space<br>
The grow and shrink behavior for both columns/rows and components are extremely customizable with MiG <br>
Layout. You can divide them into grow/shrink priority groups, so that one or a group of grows/shrinks to their <br>
max/min size before the next groups are even considered. It is also possible to set the weight for how keen <br>
the they should be to grow/shrink within that priority group. See the documentation for a thorough <br>
explanation but it is safe to say that you will not be out of options.<br>
Components and rows/columns will by default shrink to their minimum sizes if space is scarce. A <br>
column/row's minimum size is by default the largest minimum size of its components.<br>
What is normally enough to know is how to make a component or row/column grow and/or disallow it to <br>
shrink. Examples:<br>
MigLayout layout = new MigLayout(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;&quot;,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Layout Constraints<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;[grow][][grow]&quot;,&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Column constraints<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;[][shrink 0]&quot;);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Row constraints<br>
And for components:<br>
panel.add(comp, &quot;growx&quot;)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Grow horizontally. Same as &quot;growx 100&quot;<br>
panel.add(comp, &quot;growy&quot;)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Grow vertically. Same as &quot;growy 100&quot;<br>
panel.add(comp, &quot;grow&quot;)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Grow both. Same as &quot;grow 100 100&quot;<br>
-6<br>
panel.add(comp, &quot;shrink 0&quot;) // Will not shrink.<br>
Components will never &quot;push&quot; the column/row's size to be larger using the grow keyword.<br>
API Creation of Constraints<br>
Shown above is the String creation of the constraints. They are used because they are short to type and <br>
easy to read. From v2.0 of MiG Layout it is also possible to create the constraints with API calls. The API is <br>
mapped directly to the same constraints as the string version. There is JavaDoc for the API calls but the <br>
White Paper and Cheat Sheet is still the best and most complete source of information regarding the <br>
different constraints. Here is an example of the usage of API constraints:<br>
MigLayout layout = new MigLayout(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  new LC().wrap(3),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Layout Constraints<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  new AX().grow(1,3,4).size(&quot;10px&quot;,1,2),&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Column constraints<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  new AX().noGrid(1,4));&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // Row constraints<br>
panel.add(comp, new CC().grow().width(&quot;20px&quot;)) // Component constraint<br>
Further Reading<br>
This document has only scratched the surface of what's possible with MiG Layout, yet it is the only thing that <br>
is needed to make beautiful and consistent layouts. Below is a list of things that is also supported by MiG <br>
Layout. For information how to use these features go to <a href="http://www.migcomponents.com/">www.migcomponents.com</a> and press the MiG <br>
Layout link. There you will find Cheat Sheets for the constraints and a White Paper that explains how the <br>
layout manager works in more detail.<br>
More features that are supported in MiG Layout are:<br>
● The use of many different units. E.g. mm, cm, %, inch, dots, logical pixels and screen <br>
percentage. This include the use of relative keywords like &quot;related&quot;, &quot;unrelated&quot; and <br>
&quot;paragraph&quot; that will follow the design guides for the different platforms.<br>
● Grouping columns/rows/components by size to they will be the same width and/or height.<br>
● Free positioning using absolute coordinates. Edges can be linked to any other edge including other <br>
components and the containers bounds.<br>
● Full support for left-to-right and bottom-to-top layouts.<br>
● Specify how hidden (not visible) components should behave.<br>
● Button ordering and sizing depending on platform. For instance &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; will be of different <br>
size and order on Windows and Mac OS X. This is handled automatically by MiG Layout.<br>
● Last stage padding of size and position of any component.<br>
● Customization of almost any aspect of the layout engine. It is for instance possible to add new units, <br>
to specify gaps depending on component types and change all default values.<br>
● Tagging components with &quot;external&quot; so that they aren't touched by MiG Layout and thus it is <br>
possible to set their bounds manually, yet you can link to them.<br>
● All constraints are JavaBeans and implements Serializable so they are 100% compatible with <br>
persistence. UnitValue and BoundSize have custom PersistenceDelegates.<br>
● IDEUtil is a class to help integration on MiG Layout in any IDE. It can produce the source code for <br>
-7<br>
any constraint, both as API and String constraints.<br>
● Much, much more..<br>
