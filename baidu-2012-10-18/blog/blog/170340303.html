<h2>HttpComponents Overview</h2>
<p>The Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is perhaps the most significant protocol used on the Internet today. Web services, network-enabled appliances and the growth of network computing continue to expand the role of the HTTP protocol beyond user-driven web browsers, while increasing the number of applications that require HTTP support.</p>
<p>Designed for extension while providing robust support for the base HTTP protocol, the HttpComponents may be of interest to anyone building HTTP-aware client and server applications such as web browsers, web spiders, HTTP proxies, web service transport libraries, or systems that leverage or extend the HTTP protocol for distributed communication.</p>

<h2>HttpCore Overview</h2>
<p>HttpCore is a set of low level HTTP transport components that can be used to build custom client and server side HTTP services with a minimal footprint. HttpCore supports two I/O models: blocking I/O model based on the classic Java I/O and non-blocking, event driven I/O model based on Java NIO.</p>
<p>The blocking I/O model may be more appropriate for data intensive, low latency scenarios, whereas the non-blocking model may be more appropriate for high latency scenarios where raw data throughput is less important than the ability to handle thousands of simultaneous HTTP connections in a resource efficient manner.</p>

    <li>Transparent connections through HTTP proxies.</li>
    <li>Tunneled HTTPS connections through HTTP proxies, via the CONNECT method.</li>

    <li>Pluggable secure socket factories, making it easier to use third party solutions</li>
    <li>Connection management support for use in multi-threaded applications. Supports setting the maximum total connections as well as the maximum connections per host. Detects and closes stale connections.</li>
    <li>Automatic Cookie handling for reading Set-Cookie: headers from the server and sending them back out in a Cookie: header when appropriate.</li>
    <li>Plug-in mechanism for custom cookie policies.</li>
    <li>Request output streams to avoid buffering any content body by streaming directly to the socket to the server.</li>
    <li>Response input streams to efficiently read the response body by streaming directly from the socket to the server.</li>
