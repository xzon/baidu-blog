<p>MVEL is a powerful expression language for Java-based applications. It provides a plethora of features and is suited for everything from the smallest property binding and extraction, to full blown scripts.

<h2>Why MVEL?</h2>
<p>MVEL is similar to other offerings such as OGNL, and offers many of the same functionalities in that respect. MVEL is also very fast, check out <a title="Performance of MVEL 2.0" href="http://mvel.codehaus.org/Performance+of+MVEL+2.0">Performance of MVEL 2.0</a> for a comparison between MVEL and OGNL.</p>
<p>Performance isn't everything; a mantra that many in the Java community often cling to. However, MVEL does not sacrifice functionality for performance. Check out the <a href="http://mvel.codehaus.org/">MVEL Language Reference</a> to see for yourself.</p>
<p>The long term plan for MVEL will be to continue to expand and improve upon it. In fact, I am hoping that putting MVEL out as a separate offering will help spawn many suggestions and feedback on ways the MVEL can be improved.</p>

<h2><a name="Home-PotentialApplications"></a>Potential Applications</h2>
<p>MVEL is general purpose. It may be useful as an extension to anything from use in JSP Tag Libraries, to the configuration facilities of your library/framework.</p>
<p>In addition to being an expression language, MVEL also comes packaged with an equally high-performance templating system similar to Velocity and FreeMarker.</p>
