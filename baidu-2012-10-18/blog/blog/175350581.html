<p>Nelly Furtado - I'm like a bird</p>
<p><br>
You're beautiful, that's for sure<br>
You'll never ever fade<br>
You're lovely but it's not for sure<br>
That I won't ever change<br>
And though my love is rare<br>
Though my love is true<br>
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away<br>
I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is<br>
(and baby all I need for you to know is)<br>
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away<br>
I don't know where my soul is , I don't know where my home is<br>
All I need for you to know is<br>
Your faith in me brings me to tears<br>
Even after all these years<br>
And it pains me so much to tell<br>
That you don't know me that well<br>
And though my love is rare<br>
Though my love is true<br>
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away<br>
I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is<br>
(and baby all I need for you to know is)<br>
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away<br>
I don't know where my soul is , I don't know where my home is<br>
Baby all I need you to know is<br>
It's not that I wanna say goodbye<br>
It's just that every time you try to tell me that you love me<br>
Each and every single day I know<br>
I'm going to have to eventually give you away<br>
And though my love is rare<br>
And though my love is true<br>
Hey I'm just scared<br>
That we may fall through<br>
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away<br>
I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is<br>
(and baby all I need for you to know is)<br>
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away<br>
I don't know where my soul is , I don't know where my home is<br>
All I need for you to know is<br>
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away<br>
I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is<br>
(and baby all I need for you to know is)<br>
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away<br>
I don't know where my soul is , I don't know where my home is<br>
All I need for you to know is<br>
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away<br>
I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is<br>
(and baby all I need for you to know is)<br>
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away<br>
I don't know where my soul is , I don't know where my home is<br>
All I need for you to know is</p></div></body></html>
