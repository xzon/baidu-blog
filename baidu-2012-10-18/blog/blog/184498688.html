<p>n-sync-i&lsquo;ll never stop</p>
<p>Oh, yeah<br>
I'll, I'll never stop<br>
I don't know, do you believe me<br>
After all that's, said and done<br>
All the lies, how I regret them<br>
baby now, I am the loser<br>
And you're shinning like the sun<br>
Tell me why can't I still be the one<br>
Alright<br>
I will never stop<br>
Until you're mine<br>
I can wait forever<br>
Til the end of time<br>
Cause my heart is in your hand<br>
Don't you understand<br>
I'll never stop<br>
I'll never stop<br>
How could I ever<br>
When my heart is in your hands<br>
And I know, baby<br>
There is no turning back<br>
You say that I'm crazy<br>
That I kinda understand<br>
How I wished for this nightmare to end<br>
Oh, yes<br>
I will never stop<br>
Until you're mine<br>
I can wait forever<br>
Til the end of time<br>
Cause my heart is in your hand<br>
Don't you understand<br>
I'll never stop<br>
Yeah, I'll never stop<br>
Do you believe me<br>
When my heart is in your hands<br>
Don't you understand<br>
I'll never stop<br>
Til the end of time<br>
My heart is in your hands<br>
(My heart is in your hands)<br>
I will never stop<br>
Until you're mine<br>
I can wait forever<br>
Til the end of time<br>
Cause my heart is in your hand<br>
Don't you understand<br>
I'll never stop</p></div></body></html>
