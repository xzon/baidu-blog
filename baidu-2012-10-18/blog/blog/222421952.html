<p>------------------------------------------------</p>
<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
<p>Several key concepts and properties are embedded in the central classes used by<br>
the Timing Framework:</p>
<p>&#8226;Animator : This class encapsulates most of the functionality discussed in<br>
this chapter, but it is worth discussing it separately so that we can see how<br>
an Animator, and the animation it de&#64257;nes, is created and run.</p>
<p>&#8226; Callbacks: An application must have a means to be noti&#64257;ed of events dur-<br>
ing the animation. In this way, an application can be involved in the ani-<br>
mation to perform appropriate actions based on the state of the animation.<br>
Event noti&#64257;cation is handled through callbacks to an interface that appli-<br>
cation code may implement. This mechanism is similar to what we saw<br>
earlier in our discussion of the built-in Java timers, except that the Timing<br>
Framework has more callbacks with more information to enable more &#64258;ex-<br>
ibility in your animations.</p>
<p>&#8226; Duration: The duration value de&#64257;nes the length of time that the animation<br>
will last. An animation stops automatically when this duration has elapsed.<br>
You may also specify that an animation should run inde&#64257;nitely.</p>
<p>&#8226; Repetition: Some animations are intended to run once and then &#64257;nish. Oth-<br>
ers may run inde&#64257;nitely. Still others may run with a &#64257;nite duration and then<br>
repeat when they are done.</p>
<p>&#8226; Resolution: The resolution of an animation controls the frame rate of the<br>
animation. This concept was discussed at length in Chapter 12, &ldquo;Anima-<br>
tion Fundamentals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8226; Starting behavior: An animation may not want to start with the default<br>
behavior of moving forward from the beginning. It may instead want to run<br>
backwards or start from some other point than the beginning. It may also<br>
want to delay for some time before starting.</p>
<p>&#8226; Ending behavior: By default, an animation holds its &#64257;nal value when it is<br>
stopped. You might choose, instead, to have an animation reset to the start<br>
state when &#64257;nished.</p>
<p>&#8226; Interpolation: The easiest kind of interpolation is linear interpolation,<br>
which we discussed in earlier chapters. But there are other kinds of inter-<br>
polation that we can apply to give the animation nonlinear behavior.</p>
<h2>Animator</h2>
<p>Animator is the core class of the entire framework. Users of the Timing<br>
Framework create Animators with information that details the animations they<br>
want to run. The properties that de&#64257;ne an animation are set through a combina-<br>
tion of the constructors, which enable setting the most common properties, and<br>
other methods in the class. Animations are started and stopped by calling<br>
methods in this class. Finally, this class is responsible for issuing ongoing ani-<br>
mation events while the animation is running, which is discussed in the next<br>
section, &ldquo;Callbacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Creation</p>
<p>Animators are created through one of the three constructor methods:<br>
Animator(int duration)<br>
This method takes only a duration parameter, discussed later, which controls how<br>
long the animation will run. Note that this constructor takes no TimingTarget<br>
parameter. Callers would typically add one or more TimingTarget objects<br>
later via the addTarget() method; otherwise the Animator will run but will<br>
issue no events.<br>
2<br>
Animator(int duration, TimingTarget target)<br>
This variant, the most common, takes a duration and a TimingTarget. The<br>
TimingTarget, discussed in the section &ldquo;Callbacks,&rdquo; contains the methods<br>
that will be called with animation events as the animation runs.<br>
Animator(int duration, double repeatCount, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Animator.RepeatBehavior repeatBehavior,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  TimingTarget target)<br>
This &#64257;nal variant takes the same duration and target parameters as before, but<br>
also takes two other parameters that control how the animation is repeated<br>
over time, as discussed in the section &ldquo;Repetition.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Control Flow</h2>
<p>There are several methods that control the running and stopping of the anima-<br>
tion. Note that, as discussed in the section &ldquo;Duration,&rdquo; animations may stop<br>
automatically. But animations may also be programmatically halted by some of<br>
the methods of Animator described here.</p>
<p>void start()<br>
This method starts the animation, which results in callbacks to the TimingTarget<br>
begin() and timingEvent() methods, as described in the section &ldquo;Callbacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>void stop()<br>
This method stops the animation, which results in a call to the end() method<br>
of TimingTarget, notifying any targets that the animation has completed.</p>
<p>void cancel()<br>
This method is like stop() except that TimingTarget.end() will not be<br>
called for any targets. It&rsquo;s like pulling the plug on the animation instead of let-<br>
ting it stop normally.</p>
<p>void pause()<br>
This method pauses a running animation, which stops the animation in its cur-<br>
rent state until and unless a later call to resume() is issued.</p>
<p>void resume()<br>
This method resumes an animation that has been paused. The animation will<br>
continue from its previously paused state, as if no time had passed between<br>
pause() and resume(). This method has no effect on an animation that has<br>
not been paused.</p>
<p>boolean isRunning()<br>
This method queries whether the animation is currently running.</p>
<h2>Controlling a Running Animation</h2>
<p>It is worth noting that most of the parameters that control an animation, such as<br>
the duration and repetition parameters, make sense only on a non-running ani-<br>
mation. Once an animation is running, it is not clear how changes to these<br>
parameters should be interpreted. Therefore, most of the methods of Animator<br>
that set these parameters, except where noted, will throw an exception if called<br>
while an animation is running.</p>
<h2>Callbacks</h2>
<p>TimingTarget</p>
<p>Animations in the Timing Framework run by having the animation code in<br>
Animator call back into one or more TimingTarget implementations. A<br>
TimingTarget object exists to receive timing events from an Animator. The<br>
TimingTarget object is the connection between the animation running through<br>
Animator and the animation actually doing something. The callback methods in<br>
TimingTarget are given information about the current animation state and can<br>
set up object state, calculate new property values, or do anything else appropriate<br>
for the situation.<br>
When you set up an Animator, you give it one or more TimingTarget objects<br>
through one of the constructors for Animator and through the addTarget()<br>
method of Animator. As the animation runs, the Animator object calls the meth-<br>
ods in each of its TimingTarget objects.<br>
The TimingTarget interface has four different event methods to implement:<br>
public interface TimingTarget {<br>
public void begin();<br>
public void end();<br>
public void repeat();<br>
public void timingEvent(float fraction);<br>
}</p>
<p>void begin()<br>
This method is called by Animator when the animation is &#64257;rst started. It<br>
allows the timing target to perform any necessary setup prior to running the<br>
animation.</p>
<p>void end()<br>
This method is called when the animation is &#64257;nished, either because the anima-<br>
tion completed naturally by running for the speci&#64257;ed duration and number of<br>
repetitions or because the stop() method was called on this target&rsquo;s Animator.<br>
This method allows the target to perform any necessary cleanup operations.<br>
The end() method can be used as a mechanism to help sequence animations<br>
together. For example, a target can use the end() call to signal that some other<br>
dependent animation should start. Note, however, that triggers provide an even<br>
easier mechanism for this functionality, as we see in Chapter 15.</p>
<p>void repeat()<br>
This method is called during a repeating animation, every time the animation<br>
begins another repetition. Repeating animations are discussed later.</p>
<p>void timingEvent(float fraction)<br>
This method is the most important method in this interface and, in fact, in the<br>
entire framework.<br>
3 timingEvent() provides the target with the fraction, from<br>
0 to 1, of the animation that has elapsed. The target can then use this informa-<br>
tion to change whatever properties need to be changed during the animation<br>
and to schedule a repaint if necessary.<br>
The fraction value is directly related to the duration property. If Animator is<br>
given a duration of 2 seconds, then an animation that issues a timingEvent()<br>
one second after starting would call timingEvent() with a fraction value<br>
of .5.<br>
4<br>
The fraction is a useful value to have. If you want to animate some variable<br>
linearly between start and end values, it is important to know what fraction of<br>
the animation has elapsed. If the animation is halfway through, then you know<br>
to set your variable to halfway between its start and end values.<br>
Some of the parameters of Animator, such as the start direction and the reversing<br>
behavior, may make an animation run backwards. When this happens, the frac-<br>
tion values received in timingEvent() run in reverse, too. That is, the fraction<br>
always represents the elapsed fraction of the animation from the start to the end.<br>
An animation running in reverse starts at the end point and runs in reverse. So,<br>
for example, an animation that starts at the end and runs in reverse will issue val-<br>
ues from 1 down to 0.</p>
<p>TimingTargetAdapter</p>
<p>The TimingTargetAdapter class is a simple implementation of TimingTarget,<br>
providing empty methods for that interface. This class is provided as a utility for<br>
subclasses that want to receive only speci&#64257;c Animator events and do not want to<br>
implement all of the TimingTarget methods just to get the one or two that they<br>
really care about.</p>
<h2>Duration</h2>
<p>The discussion of timingEvent() relates directly to the duration property,<br>
because the fraction elapsed of an animation is calculated from the time elapsed<br>
so far and the total duration of that animation. The duration is speci&#64257;ed in either<br>
one of Animator&rsquo;s constructors, as seen previously, or in the following method:<br>
setDuration(int duration)<br>
Both the setDuration() method and Animator&rsquo;sconstructors set the duration<br>
for the animation in milliseconds. For example, an animation is assigned a dura-<br>
tion of 2 seconds through a constructor, like this:<br>
Animator myAnimation = new Animator(2000);<br>
or through a later assignment to an existing animation:<br>
myAnimation.setDuration(2000);<br>
There is one additional, important value that a duration may have:<br>
Animator.INFINITE, which tells Animator that this animation should run indef-<br>
initely. Note that such animations will still call timingEvent() on a regular<br>
basis, but the fraction value in that call will be meaningless because there can be<br>
no elapsed percentage of an in&#64257;nite amount of time.<br>
5<br>
An important concept to note in relation to duration is that all animations are<br>
tracked in Animator in fractional time. That is, an animation, regardless of<br>
actual duration, may be thought of in terms of the percentage that the animation<br>
has elapsed at any time. So any animation, other than one of INFINITE duration,<br>
has a fractional duration of exactly 1. Calls to timingEvent() during the anima-<br>
tion will use a fractional value instead of an actual duration. This mechanism<br>
tends to be easier to deal with for callers, which get more useful information<br>
from knowing that an animation is one-quarter elapsed than that it is 500 ms into<br>
whatever its total duration may be. The concept of the elapsed fraction comes up<br>
often. We typically discuss animations in terms of this fraction instead of the<br>
total duration simply because that is what Animator keeps track of and reports to<br>
its targets, and because it is much more powerful and useful to Animator&rsquo;s users.</p>
<h2>Repetition</h2>
<p>A repeated animation is a common pattern. Repetition can take the form of run-<br>
ning the same animation over and over, like an inde&#64257;nite progress bar whose sta-<br>
tus always crawls from the left to the right. A repeating animation can also be<br>
constantly reversing, like a pulsating button that has a glow effect in which the<br>
glow is constantly glowing toward full intensity and then dimming back down to<br>
some default state. Instead of constructing separate animations for each repeti-<br>
tion or creating one large animation that handles all of the repetitions as an<br>
implementation detail, the framework provides the ability to de&#64257;ne the core ani-<br>
mation and then parameters for how that animation should be repeated.<br>
There are two properties of Animator that control repetition: the number of<br>
times the animation should be repeated and the behavior upon each repetition.<br>
These properties are controlled through the following constructor and methods:<br>
Animator(int duration, double repeatCount,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Animator.RepeatBehavior repeatBehavior, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  TimingTarget target)<br>
void setRepeatCount(double repeatCount)<br>
void setRepeatBehavior(Animator.RepeatBehavior repeatBehavior)<br>
In this constructor and these methods, the repetition behavior is controlled<br>
through the repeatCount and repeatBehavior variables. repeatCount is sim-<br>
ply the number of times that the animation should be repeated. This value can be<br>
fractional, such as 2.5, to indicate that the animation may stop partway through.<br>
repeatCount can also, like the duration value, take the value Animator.INFINITE,<br>
which indicates that the animation should repeat inde&#64257;nitely. <br>
repeatBehavior can have a value of either RepeatBehavior.LOOP or<br>
RepeatBehavior.REVERSE. LOOP repeats the animation in the same direction<br>
every time. When the animation reaches the end, it starts over from the beginning.<br>
So, for example, the animation fraction being passed into timingEvent() calls<br>
will go from 0 to 1, then 0 to 1, and so on, until repeatCount is reached or the ani-<br>
mation is otherwise stopped. REVERSE creates an animation that reverses direction<br>
whenever it reaches the end of an animation. For example, the animation fraction<br>
passed into timingEvent() calls will go from 0 to 1, 1 to 0, 0 to 1, and so on.</p>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>The resolution of Animator controls the amount of time between each call to<br>
timingEvent(). The default used by Animator is reasonable for most situations,<br>
so developers should not need to change the value in general, but changing it is a<br>
simple matter of calling setResolution():<br>
void setResolution(int resolution)<br>
This method sets the number of milliseconds between each call to timingEvent().<br>
Recall from our discussion of resolution in Chapter 12, &ldquo;Animation Fundamen-<br>
tals,&rdquo; that the actual resolution may be dependent on such factors as the internal<br>
timing mechanism being used and the runtime platform. The Timing Framework<br>
currently uses the Swing timer internally, and its resolution is thus constrained to<br>
the resolution of that timer for now.<br>
6</p>
<h2>Start Behavior</h2>
<p>There are three factors about the starting state of the animation that you can con-<br>
trol: the start delay, the direction, and the initial fraction.</p>
<p>Start Delay<br>
Some animations may wish to have an initial delay before commencing. The<br>
amount of this delay is controlled through the setStartDelay() method:<br>
void setStartDelay(int startDelay)<br>
where the startDelay value is in terms of milliseconds.</p>
<p>Start Direction<br>
By default, an animation runs forward when it starts. The initial direction can be<br>
changed to run the animation in reverse instead. This setting is controlled<br>
through the setStartDirection() method:<br>
void setStartDirection(Animator.Direction startDirection)<br>
where startDirection can have the value of either Direction.FORWARD, which<br>
is the default behavior, or Direction.BACKWARD.</p>
<p>Start Fraction<br>
By default, an animation begins at fraction 0. This setting can be changed to start<br>
from any point during the animation by calling setStartFraction():<br>
void setStartFraction(float startFraction)<br>
where startFraction is a value from 0 to 1, representing the fraction elapsed of<br>
the animation. Note that to run an animation from the end to the beginning, the<br>
caller should set the initial fraction to 1 and the direction to BACKWARD. An exam-<br>
ple of this behavior is shown in the FadingButtonTF demo later.</p>
<h2>End Behavior</h2>
<p>By default, an animation will hold its &#64257;nal value when it &#64257;nishes. For example,<br>
an animation that &#64257;nishes a normal forward cycle from 0 to 1 will hold the value<br>
1 at the end. This can be changed to reset to 0 at the end instead by calling<br>
setEndBehavior():<br>
void setEndBehavior(Animator.EndBehavior endBehavior)<br>
where endBehavior can have the value of either EndBehavior.HOLD, which is the<br>
default behavior, or EndBehavior.RESET, which sends out a &#64257;nal timingEvent()<br>
with a fraction of 0 at the end of the animation.</p>
<h2>Demo: FadingButton Reprise</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re not quite done with the core Animator features. We still need to cover the<br>
important area of Interpolator. But it&rsquo;s time for a break to see some of the con-<br>
cepts in action.<br>
Let&rsquo;s look at what we can do with just the classes that we have covered so far.<br>
We have many classes in the framework yet to cover, but the power and &#64258;exibil-<br>
ity of just the basic Animator and TimingTarget classes provides enough to<br>
enable simple code that drives powerful animations. In particular, think of the<br>
things that we had to do with the built-in timers to animate our GUIs in previous<br>
chapters or the things that seemed unapproachably tedious, like cyclic, repeating<br>
animations.<br>
For a simple example, let&rsquo;s revisit the FadingButton demo that we discussed<br>
Chapter 12. While the application is not terribly complex, it is a useful example<br>
for showing how using Animator helps make animations easier to program.<br>
Recall in that example that we de&#64257;ned a custom JButton subclass with various<br>
methods for rendering the button translucently and animating the value of alpha.<br>
First, there were some instance variables to help track state:<br>
float alpha = 1.0f;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // current opacity of button<br>
Timer timer;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // for later start/stop actions<br>
int animationDuration = 2000; // animation will take 2 seconds<br>
long animationStartTime;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // start time for each animation<br>
In the constructor, we created the Timer object that ran the animation:<br>
timer = new Timer(30, this);<br>
Finally, we had an actionPerformed() method that served two purposes: It<br>
caught clicks on the button and used them to start and stop the animation, and it<br>
also received Timer events and animated the value of alpha with the following<br>
code:<br>
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae) {<br>
// ... code to handle button clicks not shown here ...<br>
long currentTime = System.nanoTime() / 1000000;<br>
long totalTime = currentTime - animationStartTime;<br>
if (totalTime &gt; animationDuration) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  animationStartTime = currentTime;<br>
}<br>
float fraction = (float)totalTime / animationDuration;<br>
fraction = Math.min(1.0f, fraction);<br>
// This calculation will cause alpha to go from 1 to 0 <br>
// and back to 1 as the fraction goes from 0 to 1<br>
alpha = Math.abs(1 - (2 * fraction));<br>
repaint();<br>
}</p>
<p>Now that we have the power of Animator, let&rsquo;s see how the code changes. You<br>
can see and run the code for this version, called FadingButtonTF, on the book&rsquo;s<br>
Web site. First of all, we need fewer instance variables:<br>
float alpha = 1.0f;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // current opacity of button<br>
Animator animator;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  // for later start/stop actions<br>
int animationDuration = 2000; // each cycle takes 2 seconds<br>
We do not need to track the animationStartTime because we no longer need to<br>
calculate the fraction of the cycle elapsed. Animator does this for us.<br>
The constructor is similar to what it was before, although the declaration for<br>
Animator is a bit different from that of Timer:<br>
animator = new Animator(animationDuration/2, Animator.INFINITE,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  RepeatBehavior.REVERSE, this); <br>
There are a few interesting bits about this call. First of all, we are using a dura-<br>
tion of only half of animationDuration. This difference is because of how this<br>
new animation will be handled. Previously, each individual animation would<br>
consist of both the fade-out and fade-in portions, which we wanted to last for 2<br>
seconds. With Animator, we can declare a more interesting reversing animation<br>
that reverses every second, which gives us the same result. Also, we see that we<br>
are going to be repeating in&#64257;nitely, which is the same behavior as in the earlier<br>
Timer example. We declare a REVERSE behavior so that the animation reverses<br>
direction every time it repeats. And &#64257;nally, we pass in this as the TimingTarget<br>
that will be called with timing events. Our object implements the TimingTarget<br>
interface in order to catch timingEvent() calls, just as the previous version of<br>
the demo received events from Timer in its actionPerformed() method.<br>
Additionally, since we want to start at an opaque value and animate toward<br>
transparency, we need to make sure that we link up the animation fraction and<br>
our alpha value correctly. Both values vary between 0 and 1 over the course of<br>
the animation, so we&rsquo;re almost there. But since our animation starts at 0 by<br>
default and we want our alpha value to start at 1, or fully opaque, these values<br>
are going to run opposite of each other. We can either have alpha represent the<br>
inverse of the fraction, so that alpha would be 1 when fraction was at 0, or we<br>
can use additional facilities in Animator to start the animation at the end, play-<br>
ing backwards. This will ensure that the animation fraction starts at the same<br>
value as we want for our alpha. We add the following code to set the Animator<br>
properties accordingly:<br>
animator.setStartFraction(1.0f);<br>
animator.setStartDirection(Direction.BACKWARD);<br>
Finally, let&rsquo;s see the actual animation code for this new version of the demo. This<br>
time, the code is in the timingEvent() method, which is the target for Animator&rsquo;s<br>
timing events, instead of the old actionPerformed() method. Compare the<br>
code in actionPerformed() to this approach for timingEvent():<br>
public void timingEvent(float fraction) {<br>
alpha = fraction;<br>
repaint();<br>
}<br>
Note that we do not need to calculate the fraction elapsed of the animation,<br>
because it is given to us. Also, the &#64258;exibility in how we de&#64257;ned the animation,<br>
starting at the end and running backwards in the &#64257;rst animation, simpli&#64257;ed our<br>
alpha calculation to simply equal the fraction itself. A screenshot of the applica-<br>
tion is seen in Figure 14-1.<br>
Figure 14-1&nbsp;&nbsp;  FadingButtonTF: same as the FadingButton demo, but with less code.<br>
This new version of the demo behaves exactly like the old one, but with less<br>
code. The demo is, by design, very simple, so it does not really show off the<br>
power of the Timing Framework as much as the simpler code that is possible,<br>
even for very easy animations. But it would help for us to develop a more inter-<br>
esting demo that shows off more about the framework. We develop this demo,<br>
The Racetrack Demo, throughout this chapter and the next one so that you can<br>
see how the different elements of the framework work together to create more<br>
interesting and complex animations.</p>
