<h3>A look at the floating-point support of the Java  virtual machine</h3>

                     
<p class="byline">By&nbsp;Bill Venners,&nbsp;JavaWorld.com,&nbsp;10/01/96</p>
<p>http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-10-1996/jw-10-hood.html?page=1</p><p>java 浮点数</p><p>Welcome to another installment of <strong>Under The Hood</strong>. This column aims to give Java developers a glimpse of the hidden beauty beneath their running Java programs. This month's
                     column continues the discussion, begun <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-1996/jw-09-bytecodes.html">last month</a>,
 of the bytecode instruction set of the Java virtual machine (JVM). This
 article takes a look at floating-point arithmetic
                     in the JVM, and covers the bytecodes that perform 
floating-point arithmetic operations. Subsequent articles will discuss 
other
                     members of the bytecode family. <br>

                     </p>
<h3>The main floating points</h3>

                     
<p>The JVM's floating-point support adheres to the 
IEEE-754 1985 floating-point standard. This standard defines the format 
of
                        32-bit and 64-bit floating-point numbers and 
defines the operations upon those numbers. In the JVM, floating-point 
arithmetic
                        is performed on 32-bit floats and 64-bit 
doubles. For each bytecode that performs arithmetic on floats, there is a
 corresponding
                        bytecode that performs the same operation on 
doubles.
                     </p>

                     
<p>A floating-point number has four parts -- a 
sign, a mantissa, a radix, and an exponent. The sign is either a 1 or 
-1. The
                        mantissa, always a positive number, holds the 
significant digits of the floating-point number. The exponent indicates 
the
                        positive or negative power of the radix that the
 mantissa and sign should be multiplied by. The four components are 
combined
                        as follows to get the floating-point value:
                     </p>

                     
<center>sign * mantissa * radix <sup>exponent</sup></center>
<br>
<br>
 
                     
<p>Floating-point numbers have multiple 
representations, because one can always multiply the mantissa of any 
floating-point number
                        by some power of the radix and change the 
exponent to get the original number. For example, the number -5 can be 
represented
                        equally by any of the following forms in radix 
10:
                     </p>

<p>For each floating-point number there is one representation that is said to be <em>normalized.</em> A floating-point number is normalized if its mantissa is within the range defined by the following relation:
                     </p>

                     
<center>1/radix &lt;= mantissa &lt; 1</center>
<br>
<br>
 
                     
<p>A normalized radix 10 floating-point number has its decimal point just to the left of the first non-zero digit in the mantissa.
                        The normalized floating-point representation of -5 is -1 * 0.5 * 10 <sup>1</sup>.
 In other words, a normalized floating-point number's mantissa has no 
non-zero digits to the left of the decimal point and
                        a non-zero digit just to the right of the 
decimal point. Any floating-point number that doesn't fit into this 
category is
                        said to be <em>denormalized</em>. Note that the number zero has no normalized representation, because it has no non-zero digit to put just to the right of
                        the decimal point. "Why be normalized?" is a common exclamation among zeros.
                     </p>

                     
<p>Floating-point numbers in the JVM use a radix of two. Floating-point numbers in the JVM, therefore, have the following form:</p>

                     
<center>sign * mantissa * 2 <sup>exponent</sup></center>
<br>
<br>
 
                     
<p>The mantissa of a floating-point number in the 
JVM is expressed as a binary number. A normalized mantissa has its 
binary point
                        (the base-two equivalent of a decimal point) 
just to the left of the most significant non-zero digit. Because the 
binary number
                        system has just two digits -- zero and one -- 
the most significant digit of a normalized mantissa is always a one.

<p>The most significant bit of a float or double is
 its sign bit. The mantissa occupies the 23 least significant bits of a 
float
                        and the 52 least significant bits of a double. 
The exponent, 8 bits in a float and 11 bits in a double, sits between 
the sign
                        and mantissa. The format of a float is shown 
below. The sign bit is shown as an "s," the exponent bits are shown as 
"e," and
                        the mantissa bits are shown as "m":

<p>A sign bit of zero indicates a positive number 
and a sign bit of one indicates a negative number. The mantissa is 
always interpreted
                        as a positive base-two number. It is not a 
twos-complement number. If the sign bit is one, the floating-point value
 is negative,
                        but the mantissa is still interpreted as a 
positive number that must be multiplied by -1.
                     </p>

                     
<p>The exponent field is interpreted in one of 
three ways. An exponent of all ones indicates the floating-point number 
has one
                        of the special values of plus or minus infinity,
 or "not a number"&nbsp;(NaN). NaN is the result of certain operations, such 
as
                        the division of zero by zero. An exponent of all
 zeros indicates a denormalized floating-point number. Any other 
exponent
                        indicates a normalized floating-point number.
                     </p>

                     
<p>The mantissa contains one extra bit of precision
 beyond those that appear in the mantissa bits. The mantissa of a float,
 which
                        occupies only 23 bits, has 24 bits of precision.
 The mantissa of a double, which occupies 52 bits, has 53 bits of 
precision.
                        The most significant mantissa bit is 
predictable, and is therefore not included, because the exponent of 
floating-point numbers
                        in the JVM indicates whether or not the number 
is normalized. If the exponent is all zeros, the floating-point number 
is denormalized
                        and the most significant bit of the mantissa is 
known to be a zero. Otherwise, the floating-point number is normalized 
and
                        the most significant bit of the mantissa is 
known to be one.
                     </p>

                     
<p>The JVM throws no exceptions as a result of any 
floating-point operations. Special values, such as positive and negative
 infinity
                        or NaN, are returned as the result of suspicious
 operations such as division by zero. An exponent of all ones indicates a
                        special floating-point value. An exponent of all
 ones with a mantissa whose bits are all zero indicates an infinity. The
 sign
                        of the infinity is indicated by the sign bit. An
 exponent of all ones with any other mantissa is interpreted to mean 
"not
                        a number" (NaN). The JVM always produces the 
same mantissa for NaN, which is all zeros except for the most 
significant mantissa
                        bit that appears in the number. These values are
 shown for a float below:

<p>Exponents that are neither all ones nor all 
zeros indicate the power of two by which to multiply the normalized 
mantissa.
                        The power of two can be determined by 
interpreting the exponent bits as a positive number, and then 
subtracting a bias from
                        the positive number. For a float, the bias is 
126. For a double, the bias is 1023. For example, an exponent field in a
 float
                        of 00000001 yields a power of two by subtracting
 the bias (126) from the exponent field interpreted as a positive 
integer
                        (1). The power of two, therefore, is 1 - 126, 
which is -125. This is the smallest possible power of two for a float. 
At the
                        other extreme, an exponent field of 11111110 
yields a power of two of (254 - 126) or 128. The number 128 is the 
largest power
                        of two available to a float. Several examples of
 normalized floats are shown in the following table:

<p>An exponent of all zeros indicates the mantissa 
is denormalized, which means the unstated leading bit is a zero instead 
of
                        a one. The power of two in this case is the same
 as the lowest power of two available to a normalized mantissa. For the 
float,
                        this is -125. This means that normalized 
mantissas multiplied by two raised to the power of -125 have an exponent
 field of
                        00000001, while denormalized mantissas 
multiplied by two raised to the power of -125 have an exponent field of 
00000000. The
                        allowance for denormalized numbers at the bottom
 end of the range of exponents supports gradual underflow. If the lowest
 exponent
                        was instead used to represent a normalized 
number, underflow to zero would occur for larger numbers. In other 
words, leaving
                        the lowest exponent for denormalized numbers 
allows smaller numbers to be represented. The smaller denormalized 
numbers have
                        fewer bits of precision than normalized numbers,
 but this is preferable to underflowing to zero as soon as the exponent 
reaches
                        its minimum normalized value.

<h3>Exposed float</h3>

                     
<p>A Java float reveals its inner nature The applet
 below lets you play around with the floating-point format. The value of
 a
                        float is displayed in several formats. The radix
 two scientific notation format shows the mantissa and exponent in base 
ten.
                        Before being displayed, the actual mantissa is 
multiplied by 2 <sup>24</sup>, which yields an integral number, and the unbiased exponent is decremented by 24. Both the integral mantissa and exponent
                        are then easily converted to base ten and displayed.

<h3>Floating opcodes</h3>
The following table shows 
the opcodes that pop two floating-point values from the top of the 
stack, add them, and push the
                     result. The type of the values is indicated by the 
opcode itself, and the result always has the same type as the numbers 
being
                     added. No exceptions are thrown by these opcodes. 
Overflow results in a positive or negative infinity, and underflow 
results
                     in a positive or negative zero. <br>

<p>Subtraction is performed on floats and doubles 
via the following opcodes. Each opcode causes the top two values of the 
appropriate
                        type to be popped off the stack. The topmost 
value is subtracted from the value just beneath the topmost value. The 
result
                        is pushed back onto the stack. No exceptions are
 thrown by either of these opcodes.

floats and doubles by the following opcodes. The division opcodes cause 
the
                        top two values of the appropriate type to be

<p>The squareItForever() method repeatedly squares a
 float value until it hits infinity. Each time the float is squared it 
is
                        also negated. The float starts out as 2. It only
 takes seven iterations before infinity is reached, which isn't nearly 
as
                        long as it takes in real life. The hex 
representation of the bits that make up the float are shown in the "hex 
value" column
                        in the applet. The "value" column shows the 
number as humans are used to seeing it. This human-friendly value is 
generated
                        by the Float.toString() method.

<p>To drive the simulation, just press the "Step" 
button. Each press of the "Step" button will cause the JVM to execute 
one bytecode
                        instruction. To start the simulation over, press
 the "Reset" button. The text area at the bottom of the applet describes
