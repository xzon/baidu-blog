 toolkits including SWT and AWT do not support Look And Feel mechanism. 
They bind their components to operating systems, which have both pros 
and cons. One of the cons is that they cannot support pluggable Look And
 Feel. Handling the drawing process to operating system deprives of 
their ability to customize component look and feel. This prevent them 
from providing Look And Feel mechanism. Look And Feel mechanism is 
becoming more and more indispensable in GUI toolkit.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Swing
 has wonderful Look And Feel support. You can even change Swing 
application's look and feel dynamically. This is an insurmountable task 
for AWT and SWT, since they handle their control entirely to operating 
system. I've heard many people complains about Sun on Swing design. They
 think why Swing can not be built on SWT like AWT. In fact, Look And 
Feel mechanism is one of reason why Swing should go in that direction. 
If Swing follows the way that wrapping existing components and emulating
 non-existing components, it cannot provide Look And Feel mechanism. 
Providing pluggable Look and Feel mechanism is an insurmountable task to
 native strategy.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Graphics and Fonts</span></span><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Since
 Swing is an emulated system, its graphics tools is much more powerful 
than those of AWT and SWT. Swing bases its whole system on two 
fundamental components, one is Java 2D and the other is AWT. Java 2D is a
 powerful library in Java. It provides rich features of advanced image 
processing, color management, graphical drawing and filling, 
coordination system transmission and font manipulations. AWT and SWT 
only provides limited access to these features. Compared to Java 2D, 
they are comparably primitive and inferior.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">JavaBeans Specification Conformity</span></span><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Swing
 and AWT was designed with JavaBeans specification in mind. So their 
component classes conform to JavaBeans specification. However SWT does 
not quite conforms to this specification. For example, there's no 
empty-argument constructor in every component classes. Every component 
in SWT must has at least a single parameter constructor. This parameter 
is the parent of the components. That means whenever a component is 
created, it must be immediately added to a component tree. A component 
cannot exist without registered native peer. By this way, SWT wants the 
components created by programmer can be automatically released when 
dispose methods of display is called.</span></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">More on Resource Management</span></span><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">SWT's
 strategy of component constructor can eliminate some possibility of 
memory leaks. AWT has the similar question about resource management. 
But it resolve the issues using a different way. When an AWT component 
is created, the counterpart peer will not immediately be added. When it 
is added to a component tree, but the tree is not visible yet, the peer 
will be still not created. Only when top container is set visible, will 
these peers be created. The method creating the peer generally is 
located in addNotify method. They generally call their parent's 
addNotify recursively until all of the peers on the component tree are 
created. When top container is dismissed by calling dispose method, a 
reverse method removeNotify will be called recursively to release these 
peers. By this way, AWT manage its resource without any interference 
from the developers.</span></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Event System</span></span><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">An
 event is the message sent to a GUI system, either from the outside or 
from the system itself, which requires certain action to be taken. These
 events include I/O interrupts from computer devices such as mouse or 
keyboard or network ports, and logical events triggered by GUI system, 
such as ActionEvent posted by a button.</span></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Single-Threaded vs Multiple-Threaded</span></span><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Dispatching
 events can follow two different models. One is called single-threaded 
dispatching model and the other multiple-threaded dispatching model.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><img src="http://hiphotos.baidu.com/hxzon/pic/item/e65fe6fed4f039675d6008b2.jpg" height="490" width="444"><br><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In
 single-threaded dispatching model, an event is pumped from the queue 
and processed in the same thread immediately. After the event being 
processed, next pending event in the queue is pumped again and continues
 the next round of cycle. In multiple-threaded dispatching model, the 
thread fetching the events from the queue launches another thread called
 task thread, and hand the event over to it for processing. The thread 
responsible for fetching the event does not wait for the end of the 
processing thread. It simply goes on to fetch next pending event and 
dispatch it.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Event
 processing usually involves changing application data. While these data
 are often the source data that components display. Multiple-threaded 
dispatching can easily raise synchronization issues. It generates 
multiple event processing threads, which might interfere with each 
other. In a stable GUI system, component should be able to keep the view
 synchronized with the model. Because of the synchronization issue, 
multiple-threaded model requires developers to be more experienced in 
concurrent programing. For ordinary programmers, it is very easy to make
 synchronization errors. Therefore many GUI system don't use this model.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Single-threaded
 model provide natural synchronizations by enforcing sequential event 
processing. AWT, SWT and Swing all use this model to dispatch events. 
But single-threaded model also has its own issues. One of them is thread
 engrossment. Since all events are dispatched by a single thread, if one
 event processing last too long, it will hold back pending events from 
being processed. If there are PAINT event holding back, then the screen 
will appear to be unresponsive. This usually make user feel that the 
software is slow. There are many such slow applications that are 
programmed by inexperienced developers. What they did is most probably 
cramming a listener method with time-consuming tasks. Swing is 
especially prominent, since it is widely used. This has brought swing a 
bad reputation of slow and ugly. In fact, swing application can be very 
responsive if you knows to thread.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Thread Safety</span></span><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The
 solution to the above issue is launching a separate worker thread to 
handle long-time processing, thus releasing the event dispatching thread
 to continue. Just like what multiple-threaded model does. But that also
 invites the synchronization issues that happen in multiple-threaded 
model. Many GUI toolkits often setup some innate mechanism to avoid 
this, for example, by a complex lock on a component tree. Developers 
don't have to worry about how to program to be safe. This kind of 
toolkit is called thread-safe. AWT is one of them.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">However,
 it is often too complex to build such GUI system and usually it creates
 a lot overhead because of unnecessary synchronization. Therefore, Swing
 and SWT were designed to be thread unsafe. That means developers have 
to program carefully when they want to do multi-threading task. There is
 a little difference between SWT and Swing about runtime behavior 
towards thread safety. SWT always checks if the action modifying 
component takes place in the event dispatching thread. By this way, 
developers can find out the probable synchronization issues. Swing does 
not have. This is a shortage of Swing, which I think should not be so 
hard to implement.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Event Dispatching Thread</span></span><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">AWT
 reads the primitive event from the operating systems and process them 
in java codes. AWT event dispatching thread is named as AWT-{OS}-Thread.
 This thread is launched implicitly by AWT system. When an AWT 
application launches, this thread starts in background, pumping and 
draining events from the operating systems. When logical events such 
button action is fired, it is passed over to action listeners registered
 on button. Developers can also listen to primitive events such as 
mouse, keyboard or paint event to write customized AWT components. This 
is generally done by extending AWT Canvas component. This component 
enables all of the available event happened on them, and by overriding 
the event processing method, you can implement a custom component.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">However,
 in Swing, this is a different thread. Swing takes AWT events as the 
input of its event system. It gets AWT events and after some initial 
processing, generate a swing counterpart event and put it into its own 
event queue. Swing has own dispatching thread, usually named 
EventQueue-0. This thread pump swing events from the event queue, just 
as AWT does from the operating system. Then it dispatches this event to 
the target components. Usually an event is first post to the top 
container components. This event is then processed by the top 
container's dispatch methods. Then it may re-dispatching or re-targeting
 this event to a swing component, which in turn continues the processing
 by its listeners.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For
 example, when a mouse moves over a Jbutton on a Jframe, an AWT event 
targeting Jframe is fired to the AWT-thread. The AWT-thread checks to 
see if it needs further processing. Then it wraps the event into a Swing
 MouseEvent object and enqueue it into the EventQueue. Upon receiving 
the MouseEvent, EventQueue-0 pumps this event out and dispatch it to 
Jframe by calling its.dispatching method. This method then translate 
MouseEvent and figure out the target Swing component. Here, the 
component is Jbutton. After that, it created a new MouseEvent with the 
new coordinations and event source re-target to the Jbutton. After that,
 it calls the jbutton.dispatch to continue dispatching. Jbutton.dispatch
 filters these event to a specific method and finally hit the point 
where it is dispatched to specific mouse listener.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">SWT
 is more akin to AWT. The only difference is that it requires the 
developers to explicitly write the event looping codes. However, the 
underneath implementation is different from that of AWT. Look at the 
code that SWT read and dispatching events, it reminds you MFC code 
style.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Event Listener</span></span><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">AWT,
 SWT and Swing have similar event listener models. They all use observer
 pattern, in which, components and listeners are connected by adding 
listeners to components. This model forms a object-net model as shown in
 the following figure. When an event is fired and transmitted to the 
component by dispatching, the component call its listeners to process 
this event. A listener can also further dispatching this event after 
processing, or it can event generate a new event and broadcast it to 
other nodes of the net. Basically there are two different way of 
broadcasting events. One is synchronously calling other listeners. The 
other is asynchronously posting this event to the queue, where it can 
get dispatched during next round of event dispatching.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Besides
 post method, Swing has some other way of dispatching asynchronous 
event. One of them is invokeLater from SwingUtilities or EventQueue. 
This method can wrap a Runnable object into a event and post it into the
 event queue. This ensures the run method of Runnable can be executed on
 the event dispatching thread, enabling thread-safety operation. In 
fact, Swing Timer and SwingWorker is implemented based on this 
mechanism. SWT also has this counterpart utilities which can 
asynchronously post events. Its invokeLater counterpart is 
display.asyncExec which takes a Runnable object as parameter.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">(To be continued ...)</span></span></p><p>Posted on: 十一月 23, 2007</p><p>Posted by: williamchen</p><p>Category: Swing</p></div></body></html>
