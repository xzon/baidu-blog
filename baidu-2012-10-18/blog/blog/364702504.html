 GUI toolkits have always been a controversial topic. The same type of 
debates also happened in other languages such as Smalltalk. In fact 
there exist such debates on every platform-independent language. It is 
especially prominent in Java because Java is the most dominating 
language today.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">So
 what’s the controversy? Basically, it is a dispute between people who 
support emulated components(or widgets, or controls) and those who 
support native components. There are two camps among Java developers, 
one of which advocates for emulated components as in Swing, and the 
other native components as in SWT.</span></span></p><span></span><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">History</span></span><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">There
 are many stories about around the dispute on the Internet. You should 
probably have already heard of them. One of them can help you to 
understand the whole picture. Let’s start with this one, in which Amy 
Fowler from Swing team is one of the protagonists.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Back
 in 1990s, there were three companies, which developed their products 
using Smalltalk. They are IBM, Digital Talk and Parc-Place. IBM and 
Digital Talk adopted native components, while Parc-Place believed that 
emulation is the way to go. At the very beginning, all things went well 
until IBM overtook the others. The other two then merged to form a new 
company named Objectshare. Then a huge battle erupted when they tried to
 merge their products into one. The native and emulated crowd fought the
 battle nearly to death. When Amy Fowler from Parc-place, who insisted 
on emulated components, finally won the victory, IBM had got all of 
their accounts, because the two companies did nothing but quarrel for an
 entire year. The share price of the company, went down to under 1 
dollar a share and were pulled from NASDAQ because of incorrect 
financial reportings.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><img src="http://hiphotos.baidu.com/hxzon/pic/item/c48e44a744d54dc3d0435883.jpg" height="225" width="444"><br><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">At
 that time, AWT had just existed. Sun had built a basic set of portable 
control classes that mapped to native components on the different 
operating systems. However AWT was very buggy. It was beyond belief this
 was just poor code that could be fixed. Just then, Amy was hired by 
Sun, and she promised to solve all of the problems by doing a 
lightweight solution. Convinced, Sun management to make her the head of 
the GUI development. Amy then hired all her old Parc-Place friends and 
they set about creating Swing.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In
 IBM, Visual Age for Java were first written in Smalltalk, which used 
native components. Then they started to migrate them to a Java code. All
 of the IBM developers are the those Smalltalk guy, and they hated Swing
 for its emulated nature. They reluctantly built it using Swing. At that
 time, it is of no doubt that Swing was ugly, slow and buggy. Therefore 
they created a project to migrate the Smalltalk native components over 
to Java. This toolkit was later called SWT, which initially means Simple
 Widget Toolkit and later Standard Widget Toolkit. It was a success as 
they released a product called Visual Age Micro Edition. The folks later
 found that there were bugs in Swing reading windows events, which could
 cause memory leaks. So they took the decision that SWT and AWT/Swing 
should not co-exist and then put the toolkit into Eclipse which is a 
tools platform derived from the early Visual Age.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><img src="http://hiphotos.baidu.com/hxzon/pic/item/1299ce954ea5281dd0135e83.jpg" height="350" width="498"><br><br></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The
 above story should have given you an overview of the history of the 
three, especially SWT. Now you might think, the reason IBM did to create
 SWT was valid and Swing should follow the way SWT has been on. Actually
 this opinion is very superficial. When you dwell upon to the nature of 
Java, you will find that it is not that simple as you expect.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Prerequisite</span></span><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">What
 is the essential feature of Java, which has influenced the decision in 
the toolkit design? Or what is the prerequisite of a java GUI toolkit?</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The
 answer comes from one of Sun's promises about Java, write once, run 
anywhere. It is one of the java's advantages over other languages. 
Before Java was created, software portability was a nightmare especially
 to those who wanted to support multiple platforms. It is especially 
true in modern days when the Internet is so popular. People from 
different parts of the world are working on different platforms. And it 
is very common for a software vendor to support multiple operating 
systems. Java’s write-once-run-anywhere promise was obvious a relief to 
developers. It can greatly improve software development productivity.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">However
 to write a portable applications, you should use those standard 
libraries, which provide platform-independent APIs. These standard 
libraries include language support, common utilities, networking, I/O 
and GUI toolkit, etc. So when Sun started to design the GUI toolkit, the
 first thing it should consider is a well-designed platform-independent 
API. AWT and Swing were designed carefully in such a way to avoid 
platform incompatibility. SWT on the contrary was initially designed 
without this portability in mind. It was first designed for an IDE, 
Visual Age for Java. And at that time, it seemed that Windows was their 
first priority. Therefore SWT API is more akin those of Windows. In 
general SWT is not as portable as Swing. Although Steve Northover, the 
father of SWT, argued that SWT is platform independent, you can easily 
find many Windows API inheritances.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Differences</span></span><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">GUI
 application is one of the major types of softwares. So Java GUI library
 should be standardized and integrated into the JRE platform. However 
different operating systems have different GUI styles and component 
sets. There are some components which exist on all the platforms and 
have similar look and feels. These common components such as button, 
label, textfield, checkbox, etc are also called standard components. 
Different gui toolkits provide different set of components. Same 
component from different toolkits may have different look and feel. GUI 
toolkit usually follows different principle when choosing component 
types and features to implement. When examining a gui toolkit, we 
generally have two different levels of concerns. One is component types,
 the other is component features.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Terms</span></span><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">First
 let me illustrate two mathematical concepts to you: LCD and GCD. LCD 
means least common denominator. GCD means greatest common denominator. 
Look at the figure below. There are three different sets standing for 
different Oses. The intersecting part is LCD of the three, while the 
union is GCD of the three.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><img src="http://hiphotos.baidu.com/hxzon/pic/item/1ab975f021e4dff9a50f5283.jpg" height="327" width="335"><br><br></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Component Types and Features</span></span><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Now let’s examine the component types and features of the three Java GUI toolkits, AWT, SWT and Swing.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">AWT</span></span><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">AWT
 component set complies LCD principle, which means AWT only has the 
common set of components which exist on all platforms. So you cannot 
find advanced components such as table or tree in AWT, because these 
components are not supported on some other platforms. As to feature set 
per component, AWT complies LCD too. It can only support those features 
available from all platforms. For example, AWT buttons is not able to be
 attached with an icon, because on Motif platform, button is not 
supposed to have an icon.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Since
 its poor component and feature support, AWT did not attract developers 
much. And it is deprecated by Sun. It is only there to ensure backward 
compatibility and support Swing.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">SWT</span></span><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">One
 of SWT’s initial goal is to provide a more rich component set than AWT.
 It adopts GCD (greatest common denominator) principle to provide a 
union set of components that appear on every platform. The idea is that 
if a component type exists on the platform, then SWT will encapsulate it
 using java code and JNI call. If a component does not exist on the 
platform, it then emulates the component by extending and drawing a 
Composite. A SWT Composite is similar to AWT Canvas. By this way, SWT 
provides a richer component set than AWT. It is worth to point out that 
SWT JNI wrapper is different from AWT. Its emulation is also different 
from Swing.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As
 to component feature set, SWT is similar to AWT. They complies to LCD. 
In early SWT versions, SWT button did not support icon attachment for 
the same reason as AWT. But later, many of those missing features were 
made up using emulations. But still, there are features which cannot be 
implemented purely by emulation. SWT has its components completely 
controlled native operating system. It is hard to extend. Only features 
like some graphic decoration can customized by emulating. So strictly 
speaking, SWT component feature set can not be as rich as Swing due to 
its difficult to extend.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Swing</span></span><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Swing
 is the most powerful and flexible of the three. With respect to 
component types, Swing complies to greatest common denominator. Because 
Swing controls all of the GUI system and it is very extensible and 
flexible, Swing can almost create any component you could imagine. The 
only limitation of Swing is its AWT containers. In Swing you still can 
not implement real transparent or irregular-shaped windows, because 
Swing depends on those AWT top containers including Applet, Window, 
Frame and Dialog etc. Except these niches, Swing has implemented almost 
all the standard components on every platform.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As
 to component feature set, Swing complies to greatest common 
denominator. It has most of the component features available on every 
platform. What's more, you can extend the existing Swing components and 
add more features to them.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">(To be continued ...)</span></span></p><p>Posted on: 十一月 23, 2007</p><p>Posted by: williamchen</p><p>Category: Swing</p></div></body></html>
