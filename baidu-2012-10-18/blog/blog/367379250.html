<p>In <a href="http://www.jasperpotts.com/blog/2007/09/nimbus-almost-done/">his announcement</a>
 that the Nimbus Look-and-Feel (LAF) is nearing completion, Jasper Potts
 described some of the technology behind Nimbus, and provided <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=1342543887&amp;context=set-72157601901078852&amp;size=o">some</a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=1343432408&amp;context=set-72157601901078852&amp;size=o">screenshots</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of Nimbus is rendered with 2D vector graphics, there is not one 
image    even for all the icons. This means that the whole of Nimbus is 
just 56k    as a packed jar which is pretty impressive for a whole rich 
look and feel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is technically impressive, but it also has the potential to 
support a  resolution-independent interface suitable for high 
dot-per-inch (DPI) displays,  a topic that has  <a title="Windows Vista UI Falling Apart at High DPI" href="http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/erwyn/archive/2005/08/01/Windows-Vista-UI-falling-apart-at-high-DPI.aspx">received</a>  <a title="High DPI Desktop Java? Sooner Than You Think!" href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t92382.html?start=0">a lot</a>  <a title="Resolution Independence in Leopard confirmed by Apple" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/06/10/24/resolution_independence_in_leopard_confirmed_by_apple.html">of attention</a> <a title="Java on the desktop - trail behind or lead forward?" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kirillcool/archive/2007/03/java_on_the_des.html">in recent months</a>.</p>

<p>Although many feel that high-dpi user interfaces are important for upcoming advances in high-resolution displays, Jeff Atwood <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000886.html">has argued</a>
  that increases in monitor DPI statistics have been slow and that  
claims of a 200-dpi future around the corner may be excessive:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regardless, it's sobering to consider that the resolution of computer
    displays has increased by less than a factor of two over the last 
twenty    years. Sure, displays have gotten larger -- much larger -- but
 actual display    resolution in terms of pixels per inch has only gone 
up by a factor of about    1.6.</p>
<p>Short of some kind of miraculous technological breakthrough, I can't 
see    computer displays reaching 200 DPI in "a few years". It's 
unlikely we'll    even get there in ten years. I'd love to be proven 
wrong, but all the    evidence of history-- not to mention typical 
consumer "bigger is better"    behavior-- is overwhelming.</p>

<p>The Nimbus UI is rendered by stateless implementations of the  Painter interface.  The colors, icons and fonts are stored in  <a title="Java SE 6 API Documentation" href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/UIDefaults.html">UIDefaults</a>, where they can be customized or read for skinning components to fit within  the Nimbus LAF.  Nimbus is likely to be <a href="http://www.jasperpotts.com/blog/2007/09/nimbus-almost-done/#comment-919">more CPU/GPU-intensive</a>  than previous look and feels, but still quite fast.  The painters  are 'drawn' built using a  <a href="http://www.curious-creature.org/2007/09/07/the-secret-behind-nimbus/">new visual tool</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have built this tool that is like a mini Photoshop or Illustrator 
   that lets you graphicaly draw all the 2D vector graphics for each of 
   the states of the components. Those graphics are then compiled into  
  Java2D painting code which is exposed as simple Painters to the    
LookAndFeel. It has support for advanced features like sub-pixel 
acuracy,    complex gradients, layers and layer effects like drop shadow
 and glow.    The tool is still something internal that we have hacked 
together but    we are working on getting it opensourced and making it 
into something    you will be able to use. Both for creating new look 
and feels and for    drawing painters that you may want to use anywhere 
in your application.</p>
</blockquote>

The first alpha build will be available shortly.  In the meantime, you can stay in touch with <a href="http://infoq.com/java">Java</a> and <a href="http://infoq.com/javase">Java SE</a> news here at InfoQ.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Nimbus Look and Feel</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Nimbus, a cross platform look and feel introduced in the Java SE
6 update 10 release, is drawn with 2D vector graphics and can be
rendered at any resolution.</p>

<p><img src="http://hiphotos.baidu.com/hxzon/pic/item/19b108f417cdaf39dcc4747d.jpg" alt="Nimbus Look and Feel Example" height="642" width="701"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Activating
Nimbus Look and Feel</h2>

<p>There are two ways to activate the Nimbus Look and Feel.</p>

<h3>Invoking
UIManager.setLookAndFeel</h3>

<p>Add the following snippet to your source code:</p>

<pre>try {<br>    for (LookAndFeelInfo info : UIManager.getInstalledLookAndFeels()) {<br>        if ("Nimbus".equals(info.getName())) {<br>            UIManager.setLookAndFeel(info.getClassName());<br>            break;<br>        }<br>    }<br>} catch (UnsupportedLookAndFeelException e) {<br>    // handle exception<br>} catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {<br>    // handle exception<br>} catch (InstantiationException e) {<br>    // handle exception<br>} catch (IllegalAccessException e) {<br>    // handle exception<br>}
</pre><h3>-Dswing.defaultlaf command line
option</h3>

<p>To activate Nimbus Look and Feel for an application, specify the
following when running the Java application</p>

<pre>-Dswing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.nimbus.NimbusLookAndFeel
</pre><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p></div></body></html>
