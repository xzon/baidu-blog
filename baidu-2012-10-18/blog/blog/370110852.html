Sometimes the game
 tends to be quite difficult as the generator brute forces solvable, 
unique solution and no-guessing grids (sounds great) but occasionally 
with complete disregard for a human?s capacity to visually scan the grid
 and discover that one solvable square.<br><img src="http://static.oschina.net/uploads/img/201104/06070852_7PmZ.png"></p><p><br></p><a href="http://www.jquery.wisdomplug.com/jquery-games/jsmario-jquery-mario-game/">5.

The Coolest jQuery Game Ever Made</a><p>This is something I was playing around with for no particular reason.
 It is completely controlled via jQuery, which is by far the best 
javascript library out there. It is<br> really cool as it is simple and lightweight, but needs the player to put the tactical skills to the best use.<br><img src="http://static.oschina.net/uploads/img/201104/06070902_qjqA.png"></p><p><br></p><a href="http://www.jquery.wisdomplug.com/jquery-games/jtypinghero-test-your-typing-skills-in-this-jquery-game/">13. jTypingHero – Test your typing skills in this jQuery game</a><p>Quickly after jCharacterfall, I came up with this game. It looks a 
bit like jCharacterfall, but is mainly inspired on and JamLegend, 
RockBand and (obviously)<br> Guitar Hero. But, instead of tapping to 
beats, you will have to press the correct character on the correct time 
in a totally random order. Each correct press will<br> make the game 
faster, which makes it harder but you ll be able to earn more points. 
Just like in the previous game, this one can be pretty fun and 
addictive, but it<br> might he<br><img src="http://static.oschina.net/uploads/img/201104/06070903_dP0e.png"></p><p><br></p><a href="http://www.jquery.wisdomplug.com/jquery-games/typing-game-with-jquery/">14.

criteria here is to understand how to read Keyboard Character Codes and

Monster Chess – The jQuery Chess</a><p>After messing about with my good friend JQuery for a few months 
(nothing intimate) I saw some potential for simple turn-based game 
development through<br> integration of PHP and MySQL. Originally I 
intended to build a mock version of Settlers of Catan called Settlers of
 Khazakstan, however, considering the game<br> play can last ~1.5 hours and few people know the rules, I abandoned that project in light of a more basic alternative, chess.<br><img src="http://static.oschina.net/uploads/img/201104/06070909_pTOg.png"></p><p><br></p><a href="http://www.jquery.wisdomplug.com/jquery-games/jquery-based-card-match-game/">19. jQuery-based Card Match Game</a><p>jQuery-based Card Match Game is a simple memory game.

the number 1. The other numbers will now disappear and be replaced by 
black squares. Now<br> click the squares in their former, numbered 
order. If you click on the wrong square the screen will blink red and 
you have lost. The square will disappear when the<br> right one is clicked, when there are no more squares you have won and the game is over.<br><img src="http://static.oschina.net/uploads/img/201104/06070912_cCJj.png"></p><p><br></p><a href="http://www.jquery.wisdomplug.com/jquery-games/game-of-life-in-jquery/">21.

amongst major browsers (IE and ACID3 notwithstanding). At least, 
similar/the same DOM<br> manipulation behavior can be reproduced across 
those browsers. Not only that, but the JavaScript rendering speed of 
engines other than Trident (IEs) is quite fast.<br> With these 
developments, it is actually possible to create playable games. In about
