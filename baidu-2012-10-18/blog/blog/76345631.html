<p>主谓一致,是指主语和谓语动词要保持人称和数上的一致.</p>
<p>主 谓 一 致 的 三 个 原 则 <br>
A 语法一致 <br>

B 意义一致 <br>
意义一致是说谓语动词的单,复数要取决于主语所表达的概念,而不取决于表面上的语法标记.<br>
1.主语形式虽为单数,但意义为复数,谓语动词用复数.<br>

2.主语形式为复数,而意义上却是单数,谓语动词用单数.<br>

C 就近原则 <br>
就近原则是指当主语由两个或两个以上名词或代词组成时,谓语动词的数要与它紧邻的名词或代词的数一致.<br>
There is a square table and some chairs in the center of the dining-room.<br>
Either your students or William knows this.<br>
提 示<br>
一般说来,究竟何时采用何种原则,应视英语习惯用法而定.但在实际使用中,如果对上述三种原则捉摸不定时,遵循语法一致的原则是一种比较稳妥的方法.<br>

A 由and连接的并列主语<br>
1.用and (或both...and) 连接并列主语时,谓语动词通常用复数.<br>
